Core concepts:
Most of the game is randomly generated, including geography, locations, NPCs, and items.

Locations are rooms, open spaces, or another type of space that the player can be in. A large object, like a wardrobe, could have a location inside of it. This means that a location is not necessarily tied to other locations.
It is also often useful to bundle locations together to refer to them as a group; such as rooms in a building or buildings in a town.

NPCs can have names, occupations, and personalities. Their personalities affect how they act and speak. Their occupation could have them going to the same place every day, such as a tannery or store.
