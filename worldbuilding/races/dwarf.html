    <h1>Dwarf</h1>
    <p>
      Dwarves are bold and creative humanoids that work metal in ways other races can hardly fathom. They live in enormous metropoli above and below ground on steep mountainsides, normally where a large ore deposit is found. Many Dwarves have forges in their homes, and are used to working hard for long periods of time in hot and smoky conditions.

      A Dwarf city is a wonder to behold, from it's steep stepped streets to it's enormous smoke-stained towers. Most existing Dwarf cities were built up slowly over hundreds of years. The heart of any of these cities is a massive forge, where raw ore is processed, refined, and melted, then cast into tools, weapons, mechanical parts, and construction materials. All of this is powered by a combination of wood, oil, and hydraulic power. The wood the Dwarves burn is collected from forests further down the mountainside and dragged up gravelly slopes and cliffs by miles-long chains. They collect oil where they can by piping it out of the ground. The streets of the cities are always filled with a thick, black smog which most creatures find entirely unbreathable, but which the Dwarves have become accustomed to.

      Dwarves have an almost supernatural ability to shape metal, even with minimal tools, and can work it into almost any form they desire. They use this ability very effectively when making their art, which is normally a three-dimensional representation of a person, object, or vista in twisted metal. Highly skilled Dwarf artists can sell their pieces across Torys for great riches, making art the Dwarves' second most profitable export after their standard metalwork. Another form of art that is common among Dwarves is music made with organs, although the deep reverberating melodies they make are not as popular among other races.

      Dwarves frequently leave their cities to find work in other towns and villages, and they are quite common in some areas. They most commonly earn their keep as blacksmiths, but can also serve as farmhands due to their great strength. Occasionally, a large group of Dwarves will also leave their metropolis to start a new city in a different location. This happens when the resources in the original location are mostly consumed or the group disagrees with the governance of the old city.

      A Dwarf may become an adventurer simply because they are seeking excitement, or possibly because they disagreed with their previous government and left in protest.
