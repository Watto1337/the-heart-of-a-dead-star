    <h1>Merfolk</h1>
    <p>
      Merfolk are aquatic humanoids with webbed hands and feet. Some can only breathe in water while others can breathe in both water and air. They live in shallow lakes and near the shore in oceans. Merfolk hunt with spears and nets, and compose riddles of deadly cunning.

      Merfolk live in stone houses on the seafloor or lake bed, built simply from piled stones. They have no doors, and enter through windows small enough to keep predators out. Aside from their weapons, each Merfolk keeps very few possessions. They might have tokens or charms made of bone, shell, or stone, but rarely much else. Their spears are usually stone or wood, but they sometimes trade with Humans for metal equipment. Merfolk are very aware of the natural environment they live in, and when they hunt, they are always careful to maintain a healthy population of their prey for the next generation. They do the same for the kelp and algae they also eat.

      In general, Merfolk are hostile to ships passing above their territory and pester them by throwing stones and dead fish. It is also not unheard of that Merfolk will board a ship and loot it or even sink it. And when a diver comes too close to their homes, the Merfolk will take them captive and kill them unless they can answer a riddle. Merfolk are famous for their riddling capabilities, and the same riddle is never told twice. In fact, skill with riddles is held in such high regard that it forms the basis for deciding the leader of the tribe. Merfolk are governed by a single leader who chooses a team of advisors and has nearly complete control over all the other Merfolk. Leadership does not change until the existing leader dies or a challenger approaches them with a riddle. When the leader is challenged, they are given ten days to think of a riddle of their own. Then the leader and the challenger hear the other's riddle, and whoever solves their opponent's riddle first takes command of the tribe. The loser is exiled.

      On land and underwater, Merfolk love to explore their surroundings. One of their driving passions is the search for new knowledge, which can sometimes lead them into dangerous situations. Sometimes Merfolk are allowed into Booksmith libraries to study (provided they can dry themselves off sufficiently) in exchange for coastal resources.

      A Merfolk may begin adventuring because they want to explore the land, visit a library, or because they were exiled.
