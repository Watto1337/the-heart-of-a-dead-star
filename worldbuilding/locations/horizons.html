    <h1>Evening, Morning, and Noon-night Horizons</h1>
    <p>
        On Torys, directions like north, south, east, and west can't mean what they do on a spherical planet. However, there are still poles, and the sun does still rise and set, so north is the direction to the north pole, south is the direction to the south pole, east is the direction to the sunrise, and west is the direction to the sunset. Near the poles this isn't necessarily very useful, but closer to the equator the four directions are mostly perpendicular.

    <h2>Evening Horizon</h2>
    <p>
        The Evening Horizon is the part of the world that is eclipsed at sunset. Along this slice, the opposite side of Torys is visible above the horizon, but there is no gap between the two. Traveling further west raises the opposite side above the horizon, and traveling east lowers it.
    </p>
    <h2>Morning Horizon</h2>
    <p>
        Similar to the Evning Horizon, the Morning Horizon is the part of the world that is eclipsed at sunrise. Along this slice, the opposite side of Torys is visible above the horizon, but there is no gap between the two. Traveling further east raises the opposite side above the horizon, and traveling west lowers it.
    </p>
    <h2>Noon-night Horizon</h2>
    <p>
        The Noon-night horizon is the innermost part of the planet. Along this slice, the opposite side of the planet is directly overhead, so the sun is eclipsed at noon each day. The magic of the eclipse is more powerful here than anywhere else on Torys.
