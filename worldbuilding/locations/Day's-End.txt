Day's End

	Day's End is a foresting outpost located near the Evening Horizon in the region of Andal. It is the nightmost controlled settlement of that region.

	Near Day's End is a large forest known as the Elking Wood; many think it is so called for the elk that can be hunted there, but in fact it is named for a great Elven king that once ruled in the forest. Wood is collected from this forest and carted back to the populous cities in the dayward plains. But collecting wood is not the outpost's only task; it is also stocked to keep watch on the forest and ensure that no nightbound creatures stray too close to civilization and cause trouble.

	Officially known as Elizar, Day's End is also a town that hosts a moderate population - mostly foresters, but also millers, blacksmiths, and farmers - and therefore has an inn. The inn is called The Old Prince and is run by a talkative woman named Natra. Her common room is the hub of news, gossip, and debates of everyone within ten miles, and Natra herself shares no less than any of her patrons.

	The mayor of the town is a man named Usen. He generally stays in his rooms and doesn't see anyone if he can avoid it, leaving visitors to his butler, Tyagr. When he must speak to people, he is gruff, brief, and always interrupts whenever he thinks someone is saying something unimportant.
	Tyagr, on the other hand, is eloquent and adept at manipulating people into thinking they've heard what they wanted to hear. He knows very well his employer does not wish to see people and tries his best to steer them away with misleading answers and vague promises.

	Rettoo is a merchant that frequently visits Day's End. He brings unique food items, art pieces, rare fabrics and more from his travels and sells them to the isolated community. Then he buys freshly cut wood from the forest to resell in towns that are far from any meaningful trees. Whenever he visits Day's End, he brings news from Dayward lands and tells stories to children and lumberjacks alike.
