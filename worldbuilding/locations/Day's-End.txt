Day's End

	Day's End is a foresting outpost located near the Evening Horizon in the region of Andal. It is the nightmost controlled settlement of that region.

	Near Day's End is a large forest known as the Elking Wood; many think it is so called for the elk that can be hunted there, but in fact it is named for a great Elven king that once ruled in the forest. Wood is collected from this forest and carted back to the populous cities in the dayward plains. But collecting wood is not the outpost's only task; it is also stocked to keep watch on the forest and ensure that no nightbound creatures stray too close to civilization and cause trouble.

	There is an ongoing market in and around the center of the town where farmers, crafters, and peddlers sell their wares.

	Officially known as Elizar, Day's End is also a town that hosts a modest population of 800 - mostly foresters, but also millers, blacksmiths, and farmers - and therefore has an inn. The inn is called The Old Prince and is run by a talkative woman named Natra. Her common room is the hub of news, chatter, and debates of everyone within ten miles, and Natra herself chats no less than any of her patrons.

	The mayor of the town is a man named Usen. He generally stays in his rooms and doesn't see anyone if he can avoid it, leaving visitors to his butler, Tyagr. When he must speak to people, he is gruff, brief, and always interrupts whenever he thinks someone is saying something unimportant.
	Tyagr, on the other hand, is eloquent and adept at manipulating people into thinking they've heard what they wanted to hear. He knows very well his employer does not wish to see people and tries his best to steer them away with misleading answers and vague promises.

	Rettoo is a merchant that frequently visits Day's End. He brings unique food items, art pieces, rare fabrics and more from his travels and sells them to the isolated community. Then he buys freshly cut wood and related products from the forest to resell in towns that are far from any trees, which is most dayward of Elking Wood. Whenever he visits Day's End, he brings news from dayward lands and tells stories to children and lumberjacks alike.

	Ahahbu is the healer of Day's End. She is constantly patching up cuts, broken bones, and worse. She has some limited magical abilities; she can cast Spare the Dying (at will), Goodberry (1/day), and she can prepare one Potion of Healing per week from 25gp worth of materials. She tries to keep one to three potions at hand for emergencies; roll 1d4 - 1 to determine how many potions she has at any given time.
	Ahahbu has a dark secret; she is, in fact, a Druid of the Eclipse. Though her powers would be minimal even during the noon-night, she becomes stronger during each eclipse. Druids of the Eclipse, like lycanthropes, derive their strength from the night-in-the-day, and become more powerful further nightward, where the eclipses are longer and more extreme. Much farther nightward of Day's End, it would be nearly impossible for a powerful druid to resist the corruption the darkness brings. Ahahbu is not severely affected because her powers are few as it is, and the eclipses are very brief in Day's End. But she does feel the pull towards the darkness, and is slowly trying to learn to use more magic without raising eyebrows.

	Naori is a farmer who breeds and maintains cattle. They are the primary dealer of cattle to the farmers around Day's End. They live in a farmhouse with a blue roof 45 minutes out of Day's End.
