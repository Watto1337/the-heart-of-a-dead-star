The Bekebel clan has inhabited Bekebel Citadel for hundreds of years, expanding its borders both above and below ground. Currently led by the sorcerer Babanak the Great and in worship of the Tuvdak the Magnificent, the Bekebel clan is the largest kobold clan on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron.

## Babanak the Great

The Bekebel clan is ruled by Babanak the Great, a powerful sorcerer who has led the Bekebel clan for 59 years. Beneath Babanak's iron-fisted rule, the Bekebel clan has grown larger than ever before, both in size and wealth.

## Bekebel Citadel

Bekebel Citadel is a great fortress built on the slopes of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, covering nearly one square mile on the surface and over 12 miles of underground chambers and halls below. The citadel is inhabited by the Bekebel clan of kobolds.

The main area on the surface of the mountain is a walled compound packed with rough buildings and winding alleys. Night and day the streets are filled with kobolds all trying to get from one place to another. The kobolds of the Bekebel clan are unusually hard-working and industrious, working feverishly day and night to enlarge their citadel, develop new technologies, or create offerings for their dragon overlord.
