title: Oro-oro-ponoro-poron
---

Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is an active volcano in one of Torys' tropical regions. It climbs steeply from its ocean shores, creating a large island covered in lush vegetation. The island is inhabited by several dragons and the kobolds who worship them.

In addition to the many common dragons living on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, Tiamat, the greatest and most evil of all dragons, has been known to erupt from the volcano's crater when she is least expected. When she does, she lays waste to any that oppose her and demands gifts of immeasurable value from those who claim loyalty. She rises infrequently and irregularly, making it difficult to prepare for her arrival.
