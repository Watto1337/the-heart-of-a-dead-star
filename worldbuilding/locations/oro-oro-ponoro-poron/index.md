title: Oro-oro-ponoro-poron
---

The great island-mountain of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to many of Torys' greatest dragons. Lying in one of Torys' tropical regions and further heated by the mountain's volcanic nature, the island is covered in lush vegetation even in the coldest winters. The slopes climb steeply from the shore, making the island a tough habitat for anyone not at home in trees or underground.

## Dragons

Many types of dragons inhabit Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Green dragons lurk in the thick undergrowth, while red dragons make their lairs near flowing lava. Blue dragons perch on offshore pillars of stone, and a single black dragon known as Ice resides always just out of sight.

### Notable individuals

#### Tuvdak the Magnificent

Over 600 years old, Tuvdak the Magnificent is the oldest red dragon on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Tuvdak is the undisputed king of the caldera, having driven off or killed a total of eight younger challengers desiring his hoard. He won his lair in from the red dragon Sarvol after an epic battle lasting days, which cemented Tuvdak's reputation as one to be reckoned with. By that time, Sarvol had driven off over a dozen younger dragons in contest for her lair, always leaving them with a crippling injury to remember her by, differentiating Tuvdak by his success.

#### Morsha the All-Knowing

One of the smaller green dragons, Morsha roams the jungle near the foot of the mountain and creeps unseen upon her prey. She wanders free from any lair and often visits the outposts and villages of the Lukurru clan, offering wisdom to strengthen them against their enemies. Though she accepts no offerings, Morsha expects greatness from her devotees and punishes their failures, often with death. Though she may not be truly all-knowing, she is indeed capable of seeing more than her eyes alone would tell, appearing to observe events across great distances and through magical barriers.

#### Ice

Ice is rarely seen on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, appearing only to torment roving groups of kobolds or smaller dragons. Ice's true name is not known, and no kobold clan worships them - some even doubt Ice is real. However, those seeking power beyond their means might leave a small offering out in the jungle, hoping Ice will discover it and pay a visit...

## Kobolds

In addition to the dragons, the island is home to the many kobold clans who worship them. The kobolds thrive in the island's warm environment and work industriously to ensure their clan's success, often in direct competition with another. Nearly all clans worship one or more dragons, and a clan's dragon overlord often determines the nature of their alliances.

However, all the kobold clans are united in reverence (and fear) of Tiamat, the evil god of all dragons. It is said that one day, when she is least expected, Tiamat will erupt from Oro-oro-ponoro-poron's volcanic crater and lay waste to those who fail to meet her demands.

### Notable clans

#### Bekebel

The Bekebel clan is the largest kobold clan on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. They inhabit Bekebel Citadel and are led by Babanak the Great. The clan worships Tuvdak the Magnificent, regularly offering him gifts befitting his title to add to his lair. The Bekebel are the sworn enemies of the Lukurru.

See [Bekebel](bekebel/index.md).

#### Lukurru

The Lukurru clan, while not very large, remains one of the most influential clans due to their large territory and unrivaled ability to travel quickly through the jungle. They worship all green dragons, including Morsha the All-knowing whom they both fear and make their prayers to. The Lukurru are the sworn enemies of the Bekebel.
