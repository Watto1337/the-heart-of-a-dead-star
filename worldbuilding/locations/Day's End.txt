Day's End

	Day's End is a foresting outpost located near the Evening Horizon in the region of Andal. It is the nightmost controlled settlement of that region.

	Near Day's End is a large forest known as the Elking Wood; many think it is so called for the elk that can be hunted there, but in fact it is named for a great Elven king that once ruled in the forest. Wood is collected from this forest and carted back to the populous cities in the dayward plains. But collecting wood is not the outpost's only task; it is also stocked to keep watch on the forest and ensure that no nightbound creatures stray too close to civilization and cause trouble.
