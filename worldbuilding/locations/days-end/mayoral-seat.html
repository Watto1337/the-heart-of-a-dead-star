Mayoral Seat of Day's End

	Outside the town hall is a small courtyard ending in steps leading up the the entrance. Inside is a waiting room, in the middle of which is a secretary's desk where Sonda, the town hall's secretary, works, or Tyagr when she's away. There are seven chairs along the walls. The desk contains two drawers, one filled with sheets of paper describing appointment times, the other filled with stationery and writing utensils.
	At the back of the lobby is a locked door leading into the town hall's library. It is not open to the public, and most residents of Day's End are unaware of it's existence. It contains mostly informative books: propaganda about Andal's governance, military prowess, and financial stability; books about the Elking Wood and the Eclipses; and books about the political and colonial history of the region. There are about 100 books in total.
	Also at the back of the lobby is a lavatory, and a stairwell leading both up and down. Going up the stairs leads to a hallway on the second floor with only three doors; one to Usen's office, one to Tyagr's office, and one to a janitorial closet (the janitor's name is Danehban and he works mainly in the early mornings). At the far end of the hallway is a window overlooking the courtyard.
	Usen's office is large, and is where he spends nearly all of his time. His desk is large and perpetually covered in papers; Usen has a bad habit of letting things pile up, even though he works almost constantly. The papers are about all sorts of things; financial allocation to the city guard, petitions for new forestry equipment, requests for better roads, memo from Tyagr about missed appointments, and so on. Inside a locked drawer are the more sensitive memos; orders from the upper government, reports of attacks on other nightward cities and demands for tax levies. He wears the key to this drawer around his neck (in order to spot it while he is wearing it, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check). There is also a drawer of stationery, including several pens, inks of different colors, a wax seal, and so on. Usen also has a wardrobe in his office. It contains his extra pairs of boots and ceremonial suits. There is Usen's chair behind his desk, and another three chairs for appointments.
	Across from Usen's office is Tyagr's slightly smaller and much tidier office. He keeps a corkboard on the wall beside his desk for pinning memos, and keeps most of his papers in a neat filing cabinet. Organization is important for Tyagr because, as the mayor's butler and general assistant, it is his job to accept all incoming missives and either handle them himself or pass them on to Usen. Thus the flow of information across his desk is much higher than Usen's. Most of the types of papers that can be found in Usen's office can also be found in Tyagr's, except the papers Usen keeps locked away; Tyagr never holds onto those for long.
	Down the stairs from the lobby, going underground, is a hallway leading to the kitchen and another stairwell down. This is where the chef, Eemika, prepares food for Usen, Tyagr, Sonda, himself, and sometimes Danehban. The room is only partially underground; there are windows near the ceiling at ground level, both to let in light and allow the room to air out.
	Down the stairs again leads into the town's tiny prison. There are two cells, each only large enough for two people, or three uncomfortably (that is, more uncomfortably than it is to be in a prison alone). They are almost never occupied, and their locks are fairly weak; the locks have AC 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Each cell contains a single small bed and a hole in the ground that serves as a toilet.
	Additionally, at the far end of the prison under the town hall is a massive iron door, elaborately engraved with depictions of armies marching to war under a darkened sky. Close inspection reveals that the soldiers are not humans, but elves. The door has no handle, but in the centre is a large keyhole. The key to this door is long lost, but the lock can be picked with a successful DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check made with thieves' tools. The lock can also be attacked; it has AC 20, 25 hit points, resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. The door itself is nigh indestructible. See Dungeon of Day's End.
