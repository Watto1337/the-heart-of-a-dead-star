Ahahbu's House

	Ahahbu has a small building to herself that she lives in and works from. There is an open living room adjacent to both the kitchen and the sickroom. The sickroom contains a bed for her patients and a table with medical equipment on it. She keeps her healing potions in a drawer under the table, when she has any. The kitchen has a wood stove that Ahahbu uses to cook food and brew her healing potions, as well as heat the building in the winter. There is a regular pantry for foodstuffs and an additional pantry for medical ingredients.
	The main living room contains two chairs, one at a large wooden desk. Above the desk is two shelves holding 10 books on healing practices, plants and fungi and animal behaviour. Also on the shelves is a bowl of some nice-smelling herbs and a small statuette of a cat. The cat is carved from wood, and Ahahbu bought it from another druid on her travels in Melios (another small town a few weeks away from Day's End). It is carved from the wood of an ash tree, which is significant to Druids of the Eclipse. The desk contains three drawers: one large drawer that contains Ahahbu's patient records; a smaller drawer that contains a pocket knife, a magnifying glass, an ink pen and a bottle of ink, and some spare sheets of paper; and finally a small locked drawer. She carries the key to this drawer on her keychain. The drawer contains all of Ahahbu's druidic equipment, which she wishes to keep secret from others. Inside the drawer is an old, worn, book titled "Magics Under The Noon-Night." It describes a number of techniques, practices, and even specific spells that a Druid of the Eclipse can use to improve their powers. Beside the book is a wand made of ash, which serves as Ahahbu's Druidic Focus.
