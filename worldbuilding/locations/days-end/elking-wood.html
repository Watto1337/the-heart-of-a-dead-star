    <h1>Elking Wood</h1>
    <p>
        Elking Wood is a large forest enclosing the westward end of Andal. It hosts ash, beech, oak, and fir trees, alongside many types of shrubs and ferns. Among the undergrowth and on trees grow many different types of fungi: edible, deadly, and everything in between. The fungi are very common and are normally found in clumps. In terms of animals, the forest is populated primarily by wolves and elk, but also by various birds, giant spiders, and a few basilisks.
    </p>
    <p>
        A thousand years ago, a large and powerful elven kingdom lay over a large portion of the forest, ruled over by King Oeged Naaftet Oecheisev. In a fit of madness and lust for power, Oeged transformed himself into a Shadow Dragon and unwittingly unleashed a terrible corruption into the forest. This magic made lycantrhopes far more powerful and granted basilisks the ability to petrify any living creature with only a gaze.

        The ruins of the kingdom can still be found throughout the forest. Some them are still inhabited by people of the various cultures described below, and others are little more than rubble. Hints of roads may be found as well, all but covered by dirt and plants.

    <h2>Denizens of Elking Wood</h2>
    <p>
        Elking Wood is inhabited by a few distinct cultures, and two noteworthy individuals as well. The cultures include elves, gnomes, druids, and lycanthropes. The individuals include Osazii, an ancient and powerful druid, and Minu'ive, an outcast elf prince infected with lycanthropy.
    </p>
    <h3>Elves</h3>
    <p>
        The elves who live in the Elking Wood are the only surviving remnants of the ancient elven kingdom, once ruled by King Oeged. The kingdom collapsed long enough ago that elves alive now have only heard of the kingdom and its fall second- or third-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        The elves live in small groups spread out through the forest. After the kingdom's fall, werewolves and basilisks slowly wore away the people's strength until they were forced to retreat to more defensible hideouts. Now they struggle to get by as their numbers slowly dwindle.
    </p>
    <h3>Gnomes</h3>
    <p>
        Gnomes have lived in the Elking Wood since long before the elven kingdom arose, and will likely continue to dwell there long after the last elf on the continent is dead. The gnomes have adapted to life under the eclipse and have learned to use magic based on plants and fungi rather than darkness. This gives them the ability to protect themselves from hostile creatures, cultivate nourishing crops, and in the time of the elven kingdom it helped them stay mostly hidden from elven law.
    </p>
    <h3>Druids</h3>
    <p>
        The druids of the forest are people of many different races who have taken the power of the eclipse into their hearts and allowed it to shape them. Though this power grants them many abilities, such as shapechanging and powerful magic, it also twists their desires and drives them to greed and hatred. Though they generally live alone or in pairs, there is a sort of community between some of the druids. They may provide help to each other in times of need, or offer food and shelter to another druid far from home.
    </p>
    <h3>Lycanthropes</h3>
    <p>
        The lycanthropes are the most individualistic of all the cultures in Elking Wood. They almost exclusively live alone, rarely communicate with one another, and compete fiercely for territory and resources. However, there are some common traits that most lycanthropes share. For example, when a humanoid is infected with lycanthropy, they generally become more direct and lose some of their ability to plan ahead. This leads to decisions favoring immediate gain, such as fighting and killing trespassers rather than asking too many questions.
