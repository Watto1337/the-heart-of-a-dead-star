Dungeon of Day's End

	The small town of Day's End is hiding an ancient secret; under the town hall is a large dungeon, blocked off since the time of the Elvish King.

	At the far end of the prison under the town hall (see Day's End) is a massive iron door, elaborately engraved with depictions of armies marching to war under a darkened sky. Close inspection reveals that the soldiers are not humans, but elves. The door has no handle, but in the centre is a large keyhole. The key to this door is long lost, but the lock can be picked with a successful DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check made with thieves' tools. The lock can also be attacked; it has AC 20, 25 hit points, resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. If the lock is broken, the door can no longer be locked. The door itself is nigh indestructible.

Level 1 - Archives

	This level of the dungeon served as the storage space for all of the legal and governmental archives of the Elvish kingdom. It contains thousands of scrolls describing accounts of legal proceedings and bill amendments. Unless otherwise specified, ceilings are 10 feet high.

	1. Entrance
	The entrance area of the dungeon is a 20x20 foot square room with stone brick walls. The north wall is largely filled with the entrance door, the back of which is engraved with an image of an elf monarch seated upon a magnificent throne. The elf wears a crown and holds a long curved sword resting upon their knees. To either side of the throne is an elf warrior, each wearing full-face helmets and weilding spears. An inscription at the top reads (in Elvish): "The sword of justice rests on the wisdom of words." On this side of the door there is a handle and a lever to lock the door (if the lock was broken, this lever no longer moves).
	In each of the darth and lith walls is an alcove each containing a stone statue of an elf warrior identical to those depicted on the door. The statue in the lith wall is largely eroded by a leak in the ceiling above it, that has slowly worn away the detailing on the helmet of the statue. These statues have also been magically animated, but their magic has decayed over the centuries such that they will no longer animate unless either one is touched. They will attack when this happens (as Animated Armor), but the statue in the lith wall no longer has the benefit of any sort of vision.
	The south end of the room leads to a T intersection with a passageway. The passageway is 10 feet wide and 100 feet long, extending 40 feet both darth and lith from the entrance room. There are torch brackets in the passage, but no torches. All along the passageway on both sides are doors leading into archive rooms (see area 2). There are eight such rooms, spread out evenly along the passageway. Each room has an unlocked stone door leading into it from the passage. These doors are engraved with simple images of trees and woodland creatures.
	Towards the Lithward end of the hallway, alternating North and South walls, the images on the doors are:
		Wolf Pack
		Ash Tree
		Grazing Elk
		Songbirds
	And towards the Darthward of the hallway:
		Mushrooms
		Monkeys
		Basilisk
		Giant Spider
	The images have no particular meaning, nor do they indicate the contents of each room.
	At each end of the passage is a stairwell leading down (see area 3).

	2. Archive Rooms
	Each archive room is 20 feet wide and extends 50 feet from the door. Each room is filled with long shelves with thousands of scrolls upon each one. With one shelf all along each 50 foot wall, one shelf along the back 20 foot wall, three double-width 40-foot shelves along the length of the room, and five layers to each shelf, each room contains 1800 feet of shelf space. Each foot of shelf space can contain up to 10 scrolls, giving each room a maximum capacity of 18000 scrolls. However, not every room is filled (and some may be overfilled, with scrolls piled on the ground); roll 2d20 + 60 to determine the percentage of 20000 scrolls the room contains.
	Additionally, the lithernmost room on the north side of the passage (the room with the Grazing Elk door) has been breached by a Black Pudding. The ooze has lived in this room for hundreds of years, eating the scrolls within and slowly clearing the shelves. This room is nearly emptied of scrolls. When the characters enter the room, the ooze will try to hide if they have a light source with them. If they don't or they get within the reach of the ooze, it attacks. It will attack the smallest character, ignoring anyone else, and it will try to flee through and under the shelves if reduced to less than a quarter of its maximum hit points.
	A character who can read Elvish can read the content of the scrolls. They are written in a formal version of Elvish that was never broadly spoken and was mostly used for official documents such as these. While none of the scrolls are individually interesting, a character reading them may learn things about the nature of the kingdom based on the amount of time they spend reading.
	1 minute: The name of the Elvish king who ruled this region was Iurede Thoilar Cilifa.
	10 minutes: The king ruled with a council of 19 other governors.
	30 minutes: The kingdom spanned a large portion of the forest and also much of the lands lithward of the forest.
	1 hour: About one third of the king's council disagreed strongly with the king and the rest of the council on a matter of great importance.
	2 hours: Said matter of great importance was the use of magic during the eclipse.
	4 hours: The king and two thirds of his council strongly supported using magic during the eclipse, as the eclipse granted them additional power. The divergent third was against this practice, citing the dangers of this dark power and the harm it was causing. The king's position proved more powerful, and the elves continued to practice magic under the eclipse.
	8 hours, and only if the characters read the remaining scrolls in the room with the ooze: The magic performed by the elves spawned evil creatures that grew beyond the elves' control and infested the forest. The kingdom was destroyed and the elves scattered. These scrolls are dated with the most recent date of any of the scrolls, although the calendar is apparently different from the modern calendar, so it is not easy to know exactly when this occurred.

	3. Stairwells
	The walls of these spiral staircases are ornately decorated with imagery of an Elvish King engaged in acts of generosity and benevolence, such as offering blessings to warriors or tradesmasters, distributing justice to criminals, or using magic to heal wounds. A character proficient with the History skill can recognize this as a simple sort of propaganda.
	Hidden in the reliefs are some gemstones. They are cleverly used to accentuate certain features, such as the King's face and the magic he performs. If a character examines the reliefs and succeeds on a DC 14 Investigation (Intelligence) check, they find 3d4 gemstones in the wall. They each require 10 minutes and the use of a crowbar or sturdy knife to remove. They are worth 50gp each.
	The steps of the stairwell are each 10 feet wide and descend by half a foot at each step, making the slope of the spiral quite shallow. The steps show a certain level of wear indicating long use. A character familiar with stonework can discern that these stairs had once been walked for millenia.
	The top of each staircase connects to an end of the entrance passageway (see area 1). At the bottom, the Lith stair connects to area 4, and the Darth stair connects to area 5.

Level 2 - Preparation rooms

	4. Star Room
	This 20x20 foot room was once used to allow clerks to easily pass between the Conference Chamber (see area 9) and the Archive Preparation Rooms (see area 6). The floor is tiled with a circular pattern of blue, green, and gold semi-translucent tiles. The pattern represents the traditional 20-pointed Elvish Star, representing the 20 forms of life (tree, bush, grass, flower, biped (elf), quadruped predator (wolf), quadruped prey (elk), winged animal (birds), aquatic winged animal (gulls), aquatic mammal (seals), aquatic non-mammal (fish), mushroom, other fungus, shapeshifter (werewolves), surface aquatic plant (water lilies), submerged loose aquatic plant (kelp), submerged non-mobile aquatic plant/animal (coral), surface plant (lichen), current (air/water), sickness (disease, virus, parasite)). A character who succeeds on a DC 16 History (Investigation) check recognizes the symbol. An elf or half-elf makes the check with advantage.
	In the Lith wall is an open entrance to a spiral stairwell going up (see area 3). In the North wall, there are two unremarkable, unlocked, doors. That each open into an Archive Preparation Room (see area 6). The Lithernmost door leads to area 6a, the Darthmost to area 6b. In the south wall is an open doorway leading into a corridor, gently curving Darthward, lined with alcoves filled with statues of Elven monarchs (see area 8).
	The Darth wall is unadorned, but closer inspection reveals that there are pins in the wall making the corners of a large rectangle. Around one of the pins is a small piece of torn fabric, perhaps indicating that this wall once bore a tapestry of some sort.

	5. Mirror Room
	This room was where the Elvish king would prepare themselves for presentation before the Elvish peoples and the council. The floor is decorated similarly to that in the Star Room (area 4), and it has the same dimensions (20x20 feet). Upon the Lith wall is an enormous mirror, 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide. The mirror is only hung on hooks in the wall, and can be removed. The mirror is also magical; it is a Mirror of the Elvensoul. A Mirror of the Elvensoul will not show the reflections of any living creatures that are not elves, and it also will not show anything they are wearing or carrying. Other inanimate objects that are being worn or carried by elves or are not being worn or carried at all are shown, as are elves themselves.
	In the north wall there is an unlocked door leading to the King's Wardrobe (see area 7). In the south wall is an open doorway leading into a corridor, gently curving Lithward, lined with alcoves filled with statues of Elven monarchs (see area 8).

	6a. Writing Room
	This room contains racks of unmarked sheets of paper, as well as three writing desks and chairs. The paper on the racks was used for writing the records of the council meetings. It does not burn, absord liquid, or fade with exposure. The only way in or out of this room is through the door in the South wall to area 4, or through an open doorway into area 6b.

	6b. Scroll Preparation Room
	This room contains four work benches. Strewn about on them are a number of tools, similar to leatherworking tools. A character proficient with Cartographer's Tools may recognize them as being the tools used to trim and square paper, although these also bear the marks of Elvish manufacture. Along one wall is a row of shelves holding more of same unmarked sheets as are found in area 6a. Also on shelves along that wall are narrow wooden cylinders, each about a foot long. The only way in or out of this room is through the door in the South wall leading to area 4, or through an open doorway into area 6a.

	7. King's Wardrobe
	Centuries ago, this room was used to store all of the official and traditional clothing of the king for them to wear at council meetings. Most of the finer garments have been removed, but there are still some remaining.
	Hanging on the wall is one full suit (pants, shoes, shirt, jacket, cape, and hat), one cloak, one set of shoes, and one scarf. The suit is of a style not seen any longer in the world; the pant legs stretch backward behind the ankles, the jacket has three layers of varying lengths from mid-torso to knee-length, the cape is trimmed as an inverted V, and the hat is made of fur and covers only the top of the wearer's head. The cloak is irridescent and smooth like silk, and by minor magic it can never become dirty. The shoes appear normal (though distinctly royal), but their bottoms are made of metal and the click very loudly at each step. The scarf is red and green, and seems to rest particularly well when simply draped over the shoulders.
	A door in the South wall of this room leads to the Mirror Room (area 5).

	8. King's Corridor
	This corridor curves as a semi-circle between the Mirror Room (area 5) and the Star Room (area 4). Along the outside wall of the curve are tall alcoves, spaced approximately 10 feet apart.
	At the Lith end of the corridor, the eight alcoves nearest the Star Room contain a stone statue of an Elven King, all dressed in their finest clothing and most bearing some item in their hands: some a sword, some a bow, some a sceptre, and some merely hold wisps of magic. The name of the monarch is given at the foot of each statue. The eighth on this side is the latest monarch, King Iurede Thoilar Cilifa. He is holding a sceptre. After the eight alcoves with statues, there are another twelve that are empty.
	On the Darth side, only the first seven alcoves contain statues. These statues have the same characteristics as the statues on the Lith side, although they represent different people. After the seven filled alcoves are thirteen that are empty.
	At the centerpoint of the semicircle, between the ten alcoves on each side, is somewhat large circular chamber with a high domed ceiling. The chamber opens to the Lith and Darth into the corridor, and to the South onto a set of enourmous steps descending into the darkness (see area 9).
	In the North wall, there is a 3x5 foot block of some translucent material. This is the activation block for the lighting system in the Conference Chamber (area 9): casting a light spell on it reflects and duplicates the effect of the spell on all other similar blocks in the floor, ceiling, and walls of the Conference Chamber.

	9. Conference Chamber
	This was the most important room of this particular complex; the Conference Chamber is where the king and their council met, before the eyes and ears of thousands of elves, to discuss laws, practices, politics, and justice. The archives on the first floor are records of these meetings.
	The room is enormous: it has an half-oval shape that extends 200 feet from the bottom of the stairs leading into it, and another 100 feet to the left and right from the centre. The ceiling is 100 feet high, and is also curved.
	The stairs leading into the room begin at 20 feet wide at the top (where they exit the round room in area 8), but spread out to 200 feet wide as they descend 50 feet over a distance of 100 feet.
	In the centre of the room (100 feet from the bottom of the stairs) is the conference table. The table is circular and has 20 chairs around it.
	Along the walls of the entire chamber are gently sloping passages that spiral around the room from the top, where they become tunnels and make their way to the surface. However, their exits caved in long ago.
