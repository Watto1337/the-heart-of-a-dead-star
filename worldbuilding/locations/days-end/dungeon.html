	<h1>The Dungeon of Day's End</h1>
	<p>
		The small town of Day's End is hiding an ancient secret; under the Mayoral Seat is a set of large chambers, magically sealed since the time of the last elven king. However, the passing of centuries has weakened the magic around the door.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dungeon contains more than simple chambers, though. The last elven king caused the entire kingdom to collapse by dabbling in dark magic; magic powered by the eclipse. These practices led to increasingly corrupt decisions within the council, and the magic itself distorted many of the creatures in the forest, creating giant spiders and basilisks. In the end, the king transformed himself into a Shadow Dragon and claimed the main council chamber as his lair. The other members of the council became Wraiths, and haunted the halls of the dungeon for centuries, seeking a way through the spells laid by their own people.
	</p>
	<p>
		As time passed, the king and his wraiths became weaker and strained less fiercely against their magical bonds. Now dormant, they await the time that the earth shatters around them and they can escape.
	</p>
	<h2>Entrance</h2>
	<p>
		At the far end of the town's prison under the <a href="mayoral-seat.html">Mayoral Seat</a> is a massive iron door, elaborately engraved with depictions of armies marching to war under a darkened sky. Close inspection reveals that the soldiers are elves. The door has no handle, but in the centre is a large keyhole. The key to this door is lost, but the lock can be picked with a successful DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check made with thieves' tools. The door itself is nigh indestructible.
	</p>
	<h2>The Dungeon</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Archives</h3>
			<p>
				This level of the catacombs served as the storage space for all of the legal and governmental archives of the elven kingdom. It contains tens of thousands of scrolls describing accounts of legal proceedings and bill amendments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The presence of the shadow is weak this close to the surface, but it can still be detected by the spell Detect Evil and Good, the Paladin's Divine Sense feature, or a similar effect. The presence is a mix of fey and undead.
			</p>
			<p>
				The walls on this level are smoothly layered stone bricks engraved near the ceiling with leaves and branches, making the chambers and passages feel like a forest bower. Unless otherwise specified, the ceilings are 10 feet high and all the rooms are in darkness.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Entrance</h4>
					<p>
						The entrance area of the dungeon is a room 20 feet wide and 30 feet long. The back of the entrance door, filling the north wall when closed, is engraved with an image of an elf monarch seated upon a magnificent throne. The monarch wears a crown and holds a wooden staff. To either side of the throne is an elf warrior, wearing a full-face helmet and weilding a spear. An inscription at the top reads in Elvish: "Do not forget the past, lest ye be forgotten in turn." On this side of the door there is a handle and a lever to lock the door.
					</p>
					<p>
						In each of the east and west walls is an alcove containing a stone statue of an elf warrior. The statues are identical to those depicted on the door, although the statue in the east wall is partially eroded by a leak in the ceiling above it. These statues have also been magically animated, and they will both animate if either one is touched. When they animate, they will attack any creatures in the room. The statue in the east wall moves slowly and jerkily due to the damage caused by the leak above it, giving advantage to all attack rolls made against it. Use the Animated Armor stat block for the statues.
					</p>
					<p>
						The south end of the room forms a T intersection with area 1.2.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Passage</h4>
					<p>
						The passageway is 10 feet wide and 100 feet long, extending 40 feet east and west from the edges of the entrance room. All along the passageway on both sides are doors leading into archive rooms (see area 2). There are eight such rooms, spread out evenly along the passageway. Each room has an unlocked stone door leading into it from the passage. These doors are engraved with simple images of trees and woodland creatures. The images on the doors are as shown in the diagram below.

					<p>
						A character with Divine Sense or a similar ability can sense a stronger fey/undead presence from the room with the Stream door. One of the king's councillors made her lair here as a wraith before retreating to the lower chamber, leaving behind a shadowy reflection of herself. See area 1.3.
					</p>
					<p>
						The room with the Spider door contains a Black Pudding. See area 1.3.
					</p>
					<p>
						At each end of the passage is a stairwell leading down. See area 1.4.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Archive Rooms</h4>
					<p>
						Each archive room is 20 feet wide and extends 50 feet from the door. Each room is filled with long shelves with thousands of scrolls upon each one. With three double-width 40-foot-long shelves spanning the length of the room, and five layers to each shelf, each room contains 1200 feet of shelf space. Each foot of shelf space can contain up to 10 scrolls (including stacking), giving each room a maximum capacity of 12000 scrolls. However, most rooms are not filled; roll 2d20 + 60 to determine the percentage of 12000 scrolls the room contains.
					</p>
					<p>
						A character who can read Elvish can read the content of the scrolls. They are written in a formal version of Elvish that was never broadly spoken and was mostly used for official documents. While none of the scrolls are individually interesting, a character reading them may learn things about the nature of the kingdom based on the amount of time they spend reading. After reaching a certain time tier, a character reading the scrolls can make a DC 17 History (Intelligence) or Insight (Wisdom) check. On a success, they gain the knowledge of the next tier. A character may only make this check once.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							1 minute: The name of the elven king who last ruled this region was Oeged Naaftet Oecheisev.
						</li>
						<li>
							10 minutes: The king ruled with a council of 19 other councillors.
						</li>
						<li>
							30 minutes: The kingdom spanned a large portion of the forest and also much of the lands east of the forest. The catacombs under Day's End were once the underground portion of an elven palace.
						</li>
						<li>
							1 hour: About one third of the king's council disagreed strongly with the king and the rest of the council on a matter of great importance. The elven kingdom collapsed abruptly at some point.
						</li>
						<li>
							2 hours: The king and two thirds of his council strongly supported using magic during the eclipse, as the eclipse granted them additional power. The divergent third was against this practice, citing the dangers of this dark power and the harm it was causing. The king's position proved more powerful, and the elves continued to practice magic under the eclipse.
						</li>
						<li>
							4 hours: The magic performed by the elves spawned evil creatures that grew beyond the elves' control and infested the forest. The king began to make increasingly corrupt demands, such as tithes of magical gifts to be given to him or death to be given to his detractors. Some of his demands were fulfilled, but not all. 
						</li>
						<li>
							8 hours: The king destroyed the kingdom with a great spell. These scrolls are dated with the most recent date of any of the scrolls, although the calendar is different from the modern calendar so it is not easy to know exactly when this occurred. The scrolls mention shadowy forces and vague monstrosities but do not give details about the spell or its effects.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Remnant of Ey-La</strong></p>
					<p>
						The room with the Stream door was once the lair of Ey-La, one of the king's councillors. After she was transformed into a Wraith and trapped underground, she made this room her domain for more than 200 years before finally retreating to the main council chamber. Despite her absence, the room still remembers her shadow and her presence, a mixture of fey and undead, may still be felt by a character with Divine Sense or a similar ability.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside the room, the floor is covered with thin wisps of shadow. This shadow is only visible in total darkness; in dim or bright light it becomes invisible. When a character steps moves more than ten feet into the room, the wisps of shadow coalesce into 2d4 Shadows. The Shadows, like the wisps, are only visible in total darkness.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Pudding Breach</strong></p>
					<p>
						The room with the Spider door has been breached by a Black Pudding. The pudding has lived in this room for nearly a century, consuming the scrolls within and slowly clearing the shelves. This room is nearly emptied of scrolls. When the characters enter the room, the ooze will try to hide if they have a light source with them. If they don't or they get within the reach of the ooze, it attacks. It will attack the smallest character, ignoring anyone else, and it will try to flee under the shelves if reduced to less than a quarter of its maximum hit points.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Stairwells</h4>
					<p>
						The walls of these spiral staircases are ornately decorated with imagery of an Elvish King engaged in acts of generosity and benevolence, such as offering blessings to warriors or tradesmasters, distributing justice to criminals, or using magic to heal wounds. A character proficient with the History skill can recognize this as a simple sort of propaganda.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hidden in the reliefs are some gemstones. They are cleverly used to accentuate certain features, such as the King's face and the magic he performs. If a character examines the reliefs and succeeds on a DC 14 Investigation (Intelligence) check, they find 3d4 gemstones in the wall. They each require 10 minutes and the use of a crowbar or sturdy knife to remove. They are worth 50gp each.
					</p>
					<p>
						The steps of the stairwell are each 10 feet wide and descend by half a foot at each step, making the slope of the spiral quite shallow. The steps show a certain level of wear indicating long use. A character familiar with stonework can discern that these stairs had once been walked for millenia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The top of each staircase connects to an end of the entrance passageway (see area 1). At the bottom, the east stair connects to area 4, and the west stair connects to area 5.

			<h3>Preparation Rooms</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Star Room</h4>
					<p>
						This 20x20 foot room was once used to allow clerks to easily pass between the Conference Chamber (see area 9) and the Archive Preparation Rooms (see area 6). The floor is tiled with a circular pattern of blue, green, and gold semi-translucent tiles. The pattern represents the traditional 20-pointed Elvish Star, representing the 20 forms of life (tree, bush, grass, flower, biped (elf), quadruped predator (wolf), quadruped prey (elk), winged animal (birds), aquatic winged animal (gulls), aquatic mammal (seals), aquatic non-mammal (fish), mushroom, other fungus, shapeshifter (werewolves), surface aquatic plant (water lilies), submerged loose aquatic plant (kelp), submerged non-mobile aquatic plant/animal (coral), surface plant (lichen), current (air/water), sickness (disease, virus, parasite)). A character who succeeds on a DC 16 History (Investigation) check recognizes the symbol. An elf or half-elf makes the check with advantage.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the east wall is an open entrance to a spiral stairwell going up (see area 3). In the north wall, there are two unremarkable, unlocked, doors. That each open into an Archive Preparation Room (see area 6). The eastern door leads to area 6a, and the western door leads to area 6b. In the south wall is an open doorway leading into a corridor, gently curving westward, lined with alcoves filled with statues of Elven monarchs (see area 8).
					</p>
					<p>
						The west wall is unadorned, but closer inspection reveals that there are pins in the wall making the corners of a large rectangle. Around one of the pins is a small piece of torn fabric, perhaps indicating that this wall once bore a tapestry of some sort.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Mirror Room</h4>
					<p>
						This room was where the Elvish king would prepare themselves for presentation before the Elvish peoples and the council. The floor is decorated similarly to that in the Star Room (area 4), and it has the same dimensions (20x20 feet). Upon the eastern wall is an enormous mirror, 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide. The mirror is only hung on hooks in the wall, and can be removed. The mirror is also magical; it is a Mirror of the Elvensoul. A Mirror of the Elvensoul will not show the reflections of any living creatures that are not elves, and it also will not show anything they are wearing or carrying. Other inanimate objects that are being worn or carried by elves or are not being worn or carried at all are shown, as are elves themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the north wall there is an unlocked door leading to the King's Wardrobe (see area 7). In the south wall is an open doorway leading into a corridor, gently curving east, lined with alcoves filled with statues of Elven monarchs (see area 8).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Writing Room</h4>
					<p>
						This room contains racks of unmarked sheets of paper, as well as three writing desks and chairs. The paper on the racks was used for writing the records of the council meetings. It does not burn, absord liquid, or fade with exposure. The only way in or out of this room is through the door in the south wall to area 4, or through an open doorway into area 6b.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Scroll Preparation Room</h4>
					<p>
						This room contains four work benches. Strewn about on them are a number of tools, similar to leatherworking tools. A character proficient with Cartographer's Tools may recognize them as being the tools used to trim and square paper, although these also bear the marks of Elvish manufacture. Along one wall is a row of shelves holding more of same unmarked sheets as are found in area 6a. Also on shelves along that wall are narrow wooden cylinders, each about a foot long. The only way in or out of this room is through the door in the south wall leading to area 4, or through an open doorway into area 6a.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>King's Wardrobe</h4>
					<p>
						Centuries ago, this room was used to store all of the official and traditional clothing of the king for them to wear at council meetings. Most of the finer garments have been removed, but there are still some remaining.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hanging on the wall is one full suit (pants, shoes, shirt, jacket, cape, and hat), one cloak, one set of shoes, and one scarf. The suit is of a style not seen any longer in the world; the pant legs stretch backward behind the ankles, the jacket has three layers of varying lengths from mid-torso to knee-length, the cape is trimmed as an inverted V, and the hat is made of fur and covers only the top of the wearer's head. The cloak is irridescent and smooth like silk, and by minor magic it can never become dirty. The shoes appear normal (though distinctly royal), but their bottoms are made of metal and the click very loudly at each step. The scarf is red and green, and seems to rest particularly well when simply draped over the shoulders.
					</p>
					<p>
						A door in the south wall of this room leads to the Mirror Room (area 5).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>King's Corridor</h4>
					<p>
						This corridor curves as a semi-circle between the Mirror Room (area 5) and the Star Room (area 4). Along the outside wall of the curve are tall alcoves, spaced approximately 10 feet apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the east end of the corridor, the eight alcoves nearest the Star Room contain a stone statue of an Elven King, all dressed in their finest clothing and most bearing some item in their hands: some a sword, some a bow, some a sceptre, and some merely hold wisps of magic. The name of the monarch is given at the foot of each statue. The eighth on this side is the latest monarch, King Oeged Naaftet Oecheisev. He is holding a sceptre. After the eight alcoves with statues, there are another twelve that are empty.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the west side, only the first seven alcoves contain statues. These statues have the same characteristics as the statues on the eastern side, although they represent different people. After the seven filled alcoves are thirteen that are empty.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the centerpoint of the semicircle, between the ten alcoves on each side, is somewhat large circular chamber with a high domed ceiling. The chamber opens to the east and west into the corridor, and to the south onto a set of enourmous steps descending into the darkness (see area 9).
					</p>
					<p>
						In the north wall, there is a 3x5 foot block of some translucent material. This is the activation block for the lighting system in the Conference Chamber (area 9): casting a light spell on it reflects and duplicates the effect of the spell on all other similar blocks in the floor, ceiling, and walls of the Conference Chamber.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Conference Chamber</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Conference Chamber</h4>
					<p>
						This was the most important room of this particular complex; the Conference Chamber is where the king and their council met, before the eyes and ears of thousands of elves, to discuss laws, practices, politics, and justice. The archives on the first floor are records of these meetings.
					</p>
					<p>
						The room is enormous: it has an half-oval shape that extends 200 feet from the bottom of the stairs leading into it, and another 100 feet to the left and right from the centre. The ceiling is 100 feet high, and is also curved.
					</p>
					<p>
						The stairs leading into the room begin at 20 feet wide at the top (where they exit the round room in area 8), but spread out to 200 feet wide as they descend 50 feet over a distance of 100 feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the centre of the room (100 feet from the bottom of the stairs) is the conference table. The table is circular and has 20 chairs around it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Along the walls of the entire chamber are gently sloping passages that spiral around the room from the top, where they become tunnels and make their way to the surface. However, their exits caved in long ago.
