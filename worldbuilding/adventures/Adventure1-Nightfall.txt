Nightfall

	This adventure begins in the common room of The Old Prince, the heart of Day's End's social network. The place is as full as it's ever been, and everyone is talking about the latest piece of news that has just come in with the foresters - the wolves are quickly moving closer to the edges of the forest and the town itself. This in itself is not entirely out of the ordinary; as seasons come and go, and the weather changes, the wolves often move around to follow the elk, their main prey. But it is summer now, when the wolves normally stay well away from any civilization and hunt deeper in the forest where the elk can be found. What's more, the wolves the foresters saw apparently looked half starved - maybe even diseased. And then to top it all off, just as the news was beginning to get old and people were starting to talk about other things, some farmers declared that their cattle were attacked by a pack of wolves. Theirs exactly matched the descriptions given by the foresters; except in even worse condition, as evidenced by the head of one a farmer brought in. Its eyes were sunken and its nose was raw; its fur was slick with a black, oily substance, and its teeth were nearly all rotted away. The mayor ordered it burned, and those who caught even so much as a whiff of the smoke gagged and were sent into fits of coughing.

	There is much speculation as to what could be affecting the wolves so severely. Some proclaim the end of the world, or the return of the Niind Death; others scoff and put it down to a hoax. But that doesn't stop them from talking about it. Tyagr, the mayor's butler, seems to care little about it, as with most matters, but answers any questions about the what the mayor is doing smoothly. However, he is in fact very worried about what is happening and is not confident in the mayor's (lack of) actions - a character must make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Tyagr's Charisma (Deception) check (+6 bonus) to determine this. If the characters insist on seeing the mayor, he tries once to persuade them to leave but leads them to Usen after that. Usen, the mayor, has been keeping quiet about his opinions on the matter, but if pressed he will say that it's not a matter for concern while looking very concerned (but he always looks concerned). When pressed further, he will say that he is looking into it but refuse to give details, saying only that "someone" went out "not long ago" to "investigate." Hand waving may be involved, and the phrase "leave well enough alone." Finally, though, he will admit that nobody is doing anything about it and he thinks someone should. This is a good opportunity to get the characters moving. If the characters attempt to intimidate Usen into telling them more or giving them what they want, have the leading character make a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the check succeeds, Usen tells them what they want to know or obeys their request (to some reasonable extent). If the check fails, Usen grumbles and loudly denies them. If the check fails by 5 or more, Usen orders the characters to leave and calls two Guards into the room if they hesitate. If the characters try to persuade Usen, determine whether he agrees, disagrees, or strongly disagrees with the request. If he agrees, no check is required. If he disagrees or strongly disagrees, the characters may attempt up to two DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) checks to change his mind. Each successful check increases his agreement by one level. If the check fails while Usen strongly disagrees, he becomes angry and orders the characters to leave after denying their request, saying they are wasting his time.

	The farmer who brought in the head of the wolf, Geris, has much to say on the matter, and he will tell anyone they meet his entire tale. It is greatly exagerrated and disjointed, but if the characters can listen carefully to what is said they may learn something useful. The story begins on a dark night, the wind howling through the chimney and all but blowing out the flames of the fireplace ("A night for trouble, if trouble would come on any night.") Then Geris heard an unearthly, even demonic, noise, seeming to come from all directions at once; it was the howling of wolves, but greatly distorted by the wind (and memory). Geris sat frozen in fear ("Those calls froze my blood to ice, I've heard wolves before, and those were not. Demons, I reckon,") but he didn't hear the noise again. A few minutes later, however, he clearly heard sounds of distress from his cattle and was shaken from his state of shock. He grabbed the hot poker from the fireplace and a large axe for chopping wood and ran outside, but the damage was already done: one dairy cow dead ("Betsuthi, my best.") The wolves fled in silence as soon as he ran out, but one wolf lay dead on the ground, gored and trampled by the bull. Geris calmed the animals as best he could, as mad as he was himself, and dragged the dead wolf around back ("I swear, it was as big as a bear,") where he left it for the night. Betsuthi was too heavy to move, so he left her in the barn. The next day, Farla (Geris's wife) and Geris prepared Betsuthi's meat to be eaten or sold ("with great sadness and anger in our hearts,") and they didn't look at the dead wolf at all until the following morning. When they did, they were no less disturbed by the diseased appearance of the wolf than they had been by Betsuthi's carcass, but they both agreed nonetheless that they should warn the other people of Day's End. So they chopped off the wolf's head, but it in a leather sack, and took it with their freshly carved meat to the town.

	Natra, the innkeep of The Old Prince, has a lot to say about the news. Primarily she is annoyed that nobody seems to actually be doing anything about the situation, and the mayor only took interest long enough to order the wolf's head burned. She will tell the characters to ask Usen for support for a venture into the woods to follow the wolves' trails, to see where they came from. Then she says that if Usen denies them, she will go to him herself ("He always listens to me; he knows how much influence I have,") leaving her chef Ewas to manage the inn while she's gone. When she does go, though, she only comes back fuming and refuses to tell anyone what happened, which was that Usen threatened to shut down The Old Prince for good and replace it with a new inn run by someone "with more loyalty". Then she tried to intimidate him (see above) and failed. If she returns in this way, she secretly gives the characters each 5gp to buy supplies and encourages them to go anyways.
