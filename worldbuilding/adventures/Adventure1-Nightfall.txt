Nightfall

Chapter 1 - News

	This adventure begins in the common room of The Old Prince, the heart of Day's End's social network. The place is as full as it's ever been, and everyone is talking about the latest piece of news that has just come in with the foresters - the wolves are inching closer to the edges of the forest and the town itself. This in itself is not entirely out of the ordinary; as seasons come and go, and the weather changes, the wolves often move around to follow the elk, their prey. But it is summer now, when the wolves normally stay well away from any civilization and hunt deeper in the forest where the elk can be found. What's more, the wolves the foresters saw apparently looked half starved - maybe even diseased. And then to top it all off, just as the news was beginning to get old and people were starting to talk about other things, some farmers declared that their cattle were attacked by a pack of wolves. Theirs exactly matched the descriptions given by the foresters; except in even worse condition, as evidenced by the head of one a farmer, Geris, brought in. Its eyes were sunken and its nose was raw; its fur was slick with a black, oily substance, and its teeth were nearly all rotted away. The mayor ordered it burned, and those who caught even so much as a whiff of the smoke gagged and were sent into coughing fits.

	There is much speculation as to what could be affecting the wolves so severely. Some proclaim the end of the world, or the return of the Niind Death; others scoff and put it down to a hoax. But that doesn't stop them from talking about it. Tyagr, the mayor's butler, seems to care little about it, as with most matters, but answers any questions about the what the mayor is doing smoothly. However, he is in fact very worried about what is happening and is not confident in the mayor's (lack of) actions - a character must make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Tyagr's Charisma (Deception) check (+6 bonus) to determine this. If the characters insist on seeing the mayor, he tries once to persuade them to leave but leads them to Usen after that. Usen, the mayor, has been keeping quiet about his opinions on the matter, but if pressed he will say that it's not a matter for concern while looking very concerned (but he always looks concerned). When pressed further, he will say that he is looking into it but refuse to give details, saying only that "someone" went out "not long ago" to "investigate." Hand waving may be involved, and the phrase "leave well enough alone." Finally, though, he will admit that nobody is doing anything about it and he thinks someone should (he suggests the characters themselves "since you seem so interested in the problem"). If the characters attempt to intimidate Usen into telling them more or giving them what they want, have the leading character make a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the check succeeds, Usen tells them what they want to know or obeys their request (to some reasonable extent). If the check fails, Usen grumbles and loudly denies them. If the check fails by 5 or more, Usen orders the characters to leave and calls two Guards into the room if they hesitate. If the characters try to persuade Usen, determine whether he agrees, disagrees, or strongly disagrees with the request. If he agrees, no check is required. If he disagrees or strongly disagrees, the characters may attempt up to two DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) checks to change his mind. Each successful check increases his agreement by one level. If the check fails while Usen strongly disagrees, he becomes angry and orders the characters to leave after denying their request, saying they are wasting his time.

	The farmer who brought in the head of the wolf, Geris, has much to say on the matter, and he will tell anyone they meet his entire tale. It is greatly exagerrated and disjointed, but if the characters can listen carefully to what is said they may learn something useful. The story begins on a dark night, the wind howling through the chimney and all but blowing out the flames of the fireplace ("A night for trouble, if trouble would come on any night.") Then Geris heard an unearthly, even demonic, noise, seeming to come from all directions at once; it was the howling of wolves, but greatly distorted by the wind (and memory). Geris sat frozen in fear ("Those calls froze my blood to ice, I've heard wolves before, and those were not. Demons, I reckon,") but he didn't hear the noise again. A few minutes later, however, he clearly heard sounds of distress from his cattle and was shaken from his state of shock. He grabbed the hot poker from the fireplace and a large axe for chopping wood and ran outside, but the damage was already done: one dairy cow dead ("Betsuthi, my best.") The wolves fled in silence as soon as he ran out, but one wolf lay dead on the ground, gored and trampled by the bull. Geris calmed the animals as best he could, as furious as he was himself, and dragged the dead wolf around back ("I swear, it was as big as a bear,") where he left it for the night. Betsuthi was too heavy to move, so he left her in the barn. The next day, Farla (Geris's wife) and Geris prepared Betsuthi's meat to be eaten or sold ("with great sadness and anger in our hearts,") and they didn't look at the dead wolf at all until the following morning. When they did, they were no less disturbed by the diseased appearance of the wolf than they had been by Betsuthi's carcass, but they both agreed nonetheless that they should warn the other people of Day's End. So they chopped off the wolf's head, but it in a leather sack, and took it with their freshly carved meat to the town.
	Geris and Farla can be found selling their beef and sharing their story at the market.

	Natra, the innkeep of The Old Prince, has a lot to say about the news. Primarily she is annoyed that nobody seems to actually be doing anything about the situation, and the mayor only took interest long enough to order the wolf's head burned. She will tell the characters to ask Usen for support for a venture into the woods to follow the wolves' trails, to see where they came from and why they're sick. Then she says that if Usen denies them, she will go to him herself ("He always listens to me; he knows how much influence I have,") leaving her chef Ewas to manage the inn while she's gone. When she does go, though, she only comes back fuming and refuses to tell anyone what happened, which was that Usen threatened to shut down The Old Prince for good and replace it with a new inn run by someone "more loyal". Then she tried to intimidate him (see above) and failed. If she returns in this way, she secretly gives the characters 5gp each to buy supplies and encourages them to go anyways.

	If the characters wish to speak to the foresters who also saw the wolves, they will find them arguing loudly with a blacksmith in The Old Prince. The blacksmith's name is Ilcaycca, and she is notorious in Day's End for picking fights every chance she gets. 3 to 1 agains the foresters (Achye he/him, Ettosso she/her, Ceesenha he/him) she'll leave before it gets physical, but that won't stop her from causing a ruckus. Right now she's trying to tell the foresters that what they saw were not wolves, but wargs. Wargs are known to be ferocious and deadly beasts, and do live in Elking Wood, but they have only ever been seen deep in the forest. They share some common characteristics with wolves, but the two are easy to identify by sight, especially since wolves are common to see near Day's End. Ilcaycca's idea has no strong basis of truth; it is clearly nonsense. If the characters try to insert themselves into this debate, they find both parties very insistent on their positions, and unless the characters do something to settle things, Ilcaycca will storm off after only a few more minutes. After Ilcaycca leaves, the foresters are still grumpy and react negatively if the characters refute anything they say. If the characters are receptive and nod agreeably, though, then the foresters will tell them what they know, with Ettosso being the main storyteller.
	Achye, Ettosso, Ceesenha, and a few others were chopping up a tree and moving the pieces into their cart. Suddenly, their horses clearly became nervous ("like they had just smelled something they didn't like.") The foresters kept an eye out but continued to go about their business. A few minutes later, Ettosso saw a wolf peering at them from the forest. She alerted the others, and together they watched the wolf turn away and walk around their work area. Then they saw that there were at least 4 other wolves behind it, all going in the same direction. They didn't ever approach the work site, nor did they ever make a noise ("rather eerie"). From afar, though the foresters couldn't see them very clearly, they could see that the wolves were lean and had patches of matted or missing fur.

	At this point the characters hopefully want to follow the wolves into the forest. But before they do, they might want supplies.	
	Rettoo is not in town, so any exotic materials like silk rope or alchemist's fire will not be available. Food can be bought at the market from any farmer (Geris and Farla are there selling beef and telling their story), and other basic equipment (rope, torches, pots, etc.) can be bought from peddlers and crafters there. Simple weapons and light armour can be bought from any blacksmith or leatherworker on demand, while medium and heavy armour will take time to tailor properly. Martial weapons can be bought from a few blacksmiths, but not all. They are not difficult to find, though.
	If the characters ask about Potions or other magical items, they will be directed to Ahahbu, the healer. She has 1d3 Potions of Healing on hand when the characters arrive, but she does not sell them immediately for any amount of gold ("I need these potions for my patients - you never know when someone might lose an arm around here"), but if the characters press further she inquires what they want it for (if they haven't already said). When she learns that they intend to venture into Elking Wood to investigate the cause of the wolves' advances, she becomes interested. She offers to give one potion to the characters if they agree to bring back a physical piece of whatever it is they find, be it fungus, rotting carcass, or magical item. She claims she wants it so she can study it and learn how to prevent against it in the future. This is almost the whole truth, but if any character succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check on this statement, they glean that she hopes it is a magical cause and wants to investigate its magical properties to improve her own skills.
