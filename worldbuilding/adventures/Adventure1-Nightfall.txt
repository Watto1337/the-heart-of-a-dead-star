Nightfall

	This adventure begins in the common room of The Old Prince (see Day's End). The place is as full as it's ever been, and everyone is talking about the latest piece of news that has just come in with the foresters - the wolves are quickly moving closer to the edges of the forest and the town itself. This in itself is not entirely out of the ordinary; as seasons come and go, and the weather changes, the wolves often move around to follow the elk, their prey. But it is summer now, when the wolves normally stay well away from any civilization and hunt deeper in the forest where the elk can be found. What's more, the wolves the foresters saw apparently looked half starved - maybe even diseased. And then to top it all off, just as the news was beginning to get old and people were starting to talk about other things, some farmers declared that their cattle were attacked by a pack of wolves. Theirs exactly matched the descriptions given by the foresters; except in even worse condition, as evidenced by the head of one a farmer brought in. Its eyes were sunken and its nose was raw; its fur was slick with a black, oily substance, and its teeth were nearly all rotted away. The mayor ordered it burned, and those who caught even so much as a whiff of the smoke gagged and coughed their lungs out.

	There is much speculation as to what could be affecting the wolves so severely. Some proclaim the end of the world, or the return of the Niind Death; others scoff and put it down to contaminated drinking water, or a hoax. But that doesn't stop them from talking about it. Tyagr, the mayor's butler, seems to care little about it, as with most matters, but answers any questions about the mayor's response smoothly. However, he is in fact very worried about what is happening and is not confident in the mayor's (lack of) actions - a character must make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Tyagr's Charisma (Deception) check (+4 bonus) to determine this. If the character's insist on seeing the mayor, he tries once to persuade them to leave but leads them to Usen after that. Usen, the mayor has been keeping quiet about his opinions on the matter, but if pressed he will say that it's not a matter for concern while looking very concerned (but he always looks concerned). When pressed further, he will say that he is looking into it but refuse to give details, saying only that "someone" went out "not long ago" to "investigate." Hand waving may be involved, and the phrase "leave well enough alone." Finally, though, he will admit that nobody is doing anything about it and he thinks someone should. This is a good opportunity to get the characters moving. If the characters attempt to intimidate Usen into telling them more or giving them what they want, have the leading character make a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the check succeeds, Usen tells them what they want to know or obeys their request (to some reasonable extent). If the check fails, Usen grumbles and loudly denies them. If the check fails by 5 or more, Usen orders the characters to leave and calls two Guards into the room if they hesitate. If the characters try to persuade Usen, determine whether he agrees, disagrees, or strongly disagrees with the request. If he agrees, no check is required. If he disagrees or strongly disagrees, the characters may attempt up to two DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) checks to change his mind. Each successful check increases his agreement by one level. If the check fails while Usen strongly disagrees, he becomes angry and orders the characters to leave after denying their request, saying they are wasting his time.
