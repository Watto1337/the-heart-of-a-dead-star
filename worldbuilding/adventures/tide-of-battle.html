    <h1>Tide of Battle</h1>
    <p>
      Tide of Battle is an adventure meant for 5th-level characters and takes place across Andal, Leuber, Sibal, and the waters between them. The story of the adventure follows a war of conquest between Andal and Leuber and the outcome depends entirely on the characters' choices.

        <h2>Call to Action</h2>
        <p>
          The adventure begins in Sayrenvar, the capital city of Andal. Sayrenvar is a sprawling coastal city that bulges out from its huge Inner Harbour into the inland plains. On the northern coast of Andal, Sayrenvar is also just east of the Evening Horizon and so does not experience eclipses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sayrenvar is the center of the universe for all of Andal's wealthy politicians; the country's five oligarchs live in the city and rule from it, as do the rulers of many other cities in Andal. If it were more admitting to diplomats, there would also be significant international activity. As it is, most of the traffic through the Inner Harbour is trade from other parts of Andal and only one in ten ships hails from Sibal or Leuber.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, many unmarked ships have left Sayrenvar with unpublicized cargo and have not returned. The ships were unmarked, and those who claim to have known the crews say they went dark a few days before each sailing. Rumors have begun to grow about what the contents of the ships may have been; some say bars of pure gold, others say weapons of war, and some believe Andal's rulers are fleeing an upcoming disaster. Whatever it is, the ships are being spoken of increasingly often across the city - getting the attention of various organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesser politicians, merchants, pirates, and people of all sorts may be interested in the mystery cargo of these ships for their own reasons. Whatever these reasons are, they should eventually reach the ears of the characters. In whatever way seems most fitting, the characters should be ordered (individually or as a group) to join the crew of the Dulcet Swine, a small and fast ship on a mission of intelligence. The primary objective is to discover as much as possible about the mystery ships leaving the Inner Harbour, including their cargo, captains, destinations, and owners.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dulcet Swine</h3>
        <p>
          The Dulcet Swine is a small ship made for carrying light loads and few passengers, and can be crewed by as few as three crew in addition to its captain. It has spent many years on the water and has brought good profits to its current owners. Most of this profit was gained through standard and legal means, such as buying rare and valuable items from distant lands and importing them to Andal. Some of the profit came instead from special orders carried under the cover of darkness, but the typical passenger wouldn't know this.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is appropriate, any of the characters may be a part of the crew in place of one of the listed NPCs.

            <h3>Captain Eltora</h3>
            <p>
              Captain Eltora is a lively Human of 27 years. If she didn't spend hours each day in the rigging of her ship, there would be no doubt that she has spent more time on a deck than on land. A seafarer since her youth, she learned how to sail on her father's ship and has earned a mighty reputation aboard her own vessel, the Dulcet Swine. Eltora is known for her quick way of speaking and her snappy decisions - some might even say impulsive. When profit is to be had Eltora is always first on the scene and when danger looms she's the first to turn tail. She'll suffer no back talk on her ship nor hesitance to obey her orders.

            <h3>First Mate Laurie</h3>
            <p>
              Laurie, the First Mate of the Dulcet Swine, is a Dwarf of exceptional intelligence. His immediate grasp of unfamiliar topics is unrivaled and his memory is faultless. Laurie has known Eltora since her childhood and considers himself largely responsible for her success, which he proudly flaunts at every opportunity. He likes using big words and showing off his deep understanding of every science under the sun.

            <h3>Raadi</h3>
            <p>
              Raadi is a Human sailor from the distant land of Soale. He speaks with a thick accent but otherwise has fully adopted the Andalese way of life. He is quite talkative and very friendly, both trusting and earning trust easily. He loves to play tricks on his friends (almost everyone) and tell stories.

            <h3>Di</h3>
            <p>
              Di is an Elf sailor of mysterious origins. She claims to be from Sibal but never seems to get the details straight - her story changes at every telling. Despite this, she enjoys good company and, while being slower to make friends than Raadi, can still become a kind and loving companion in time.
