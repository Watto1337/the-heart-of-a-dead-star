title: Tuvdak's Gift
---

Tuvdak's Gift is a lighthearted standalone adventure designed to be completed in one session. The adventure takes place in the citadel of Bekebel, beneath the shadow of the fiery mountain Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Since Bekebel is inhabited only by Kobolds, all the characters in this adventure should also be Kobolds.
