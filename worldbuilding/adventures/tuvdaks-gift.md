title: Tuvdak's Gift
---

Tuvdak's Gift is a lighthearted standalone adventure designed to be completed in one session. The adventure takes place in **Bekebel Citadel**, beneath the shadow of the fiery mountain **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**. Since **Bekebel** is inhabited only by kobolds, all the characters in this adventure should also be kobolds.

## Overview

The first chapter of Tuvdak's Gift introduces the **Crown of Noruchtohl** and explains its importance as a gift to **Tuvdak the Magnificent**. It also covers the characters' perspective of the incident causing its loss.

What the characters will discover over the course of the adventure is that the crown was stolen by **Paparnad the Mystic** and two of his students, **Taccar the Arcane** and **Satasha the Runed**. The scheme was as follows: Taccar would swing from the ceiling, knocking the crown into the crowd, where Satasha would take it using any means necessary and flee beneath the cover of a Cloak of Invisibility. Then she would meet up with Paparnad, give him the crown and the cloak, and return magically disguised as Paparnad to delay any suspicions.

The plan was executed well, and Satasha managed to grab the crown and escape. Taccar was sadly incinerated. Satasha then met with Paparnad roughly half an hour after the crown was taken and began making her way back up to the surface. If the characters follow the typical adventure path, they will encounter her as they themselves descend to the same specified location.

The first chapter concludes in the throne room of **Babanak the Great**, where he instructs the characters to seek and retrieve the crown. He also mentions that Paparnad is nowhere to be found - a hint of his guilt.

The second chapter sends the characters on their way to find the crown. They will likely wish to search the **Great Hall** first, where the crown was sent tumbling into a crowd of thousands. There they may find a scrap of fabric - a torn piece of Satasha's Cloak of Invisibility. Knowing that Cloaks of Invisibility are virtually unheard of on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, the characters should begin to suspect that whoever orchestrated this plot must have significant resources at their disposal and strong connections in high places.

In their explorations of the citadel's underground, the characters may encounter **Satasha the Runed** on her way to see Babanak. Magically disguised as Paparnad, her goal is to provide him with an alibi. Satasha's lies and misdirection may lead the characters on a wild goose chase before they discover her deception. Alternatively, with the right incentives, she could become a useful ally.

During this time, the characters may wish to search the private chambers of **Paparnad the Mystic**. In Paparnad's rooms, they might find a hidden note leading them deeper into the tunnels in pursuit.

The third chapter details the characters' pursuit of Paparnad through the tunnels and caverns below **Bekebel Citadel**. Along the way they might find hints of Paparnad's passing, but magical tools like the **Gorgor Counter** will likely be of more use. As they descend ever deeper, leaving the carved tunnels and entering the natural caves, the characters will have to fight dark monsters and might encounter an unfriendly dragon.

The fourth and final chapter sees the characters finally catch up with Paparnad above a deep chasm flooded with magma. The climactic battle hopefully ends with the characters defeating Paparnad and retrieving the crown. The chapter ends as the characters return with the crown and personally present it to **Tuvdak the Magnificent**. Finally, now with a preferable replacement, Tuvdak drops his older crown on the ground in front of the characters as a reward for their tremendous efforts.

## Chapter 1 - The Gift

This adventure begins in the throne room of **Babanak the Great**, where the characters have all been gathered. They are here to receive important instructions from Babanak: they must find and retrieve the **Crown of Noruchtohl**, a powerful artifact crafted by Babanak himself and intended as a gift to the red dragon **Tuvdak the Magnificent**. The crown was lost in a crowd of thosands mere minutes before, as the players will soon see and the characters are already aware.

Babanak opens with the following monologue.

> My loyal friends! You are some of our clan's most capable members. You have a capacity for adventure that few others possess, and I would trust all of you with someone else's life. As I'm sure you are painfully aware, we have suffered a great loss today. The Crown of Noruchtohl, an artifact of my own creation, was lost - nay, *stolen* - not more than a quarter of an hour ago. Meant as an offering to our great overlord Tuvdak the Magnificent, we are now bereft of any gift to give him and *time is running out*!

Babanak spits these last words with a startling fury, but he quickly settles.

> I can't help but remember how it happened. It feels like an age has passed since then, since we were all in the Great Hall...

### How it happened

Half an hour earlier in **Bekebel Citadel**'s **Great Hall**, thousands of kobolds are gathered to witness **Babanak the Great** reveal the latest gift he made for Tuvdak. Babanak stands at the front of the stage at the head of the hall, with **Lomon the Warrior** and two other soldiers at his side. At the back of the stage stands **Paparnad the Mystic**, and sitting next to him is **Elned the Wise**.

Babanak steps forward. Then, his voice magically amplified, he addresses the massive crowd.

> Friends, kobolds, countrymen! I am Babanak the Great!

The entire crowd cheers and starts chanting: "*Babanak! Babanak! Babanak!*" Babanak continues when they finish.

> It is our tradition and custom to give to Tuvdak the Magnificent, king of the caldera, a gift on every ninth day. Today is one of those days!

The crowd cheers and chants: "*Tuvdak! Tuvdak! Tuvdak!*"

> It is also our tradition to give a gift of greater value on every ninth ninth day. Today is one of those days!

The crowd cheers again, louder than before.

> And today is also the shortest day of the year, warranting a gift of *even greater* value to our magnificent overlord!

This time the cheering of the amassed kobolds seems to make the ground itself shake, but Babanak cuts it short.

> But there's more! On this day, 333 years ago, **Tuvdak the Magnificent** defeated **Sarvol the Peerless** in an epic battle for her lair. To mark this special anniversary we will give to Tuvdak a gift *greater than any that has ever been given*! Behold the Crown of Noruchtohl!

As Babanak lifts the crown from a box at his feet, the crowd goes wild. Some are chanting Babanak's name and others Tuvdak's, but most are simply expressing themselves with a lot of noise. Babanak revels in the crowd's adoration and holds the crown aloft for all to see.

But as Babanak stands at the front of the stage, a few kobolds begin to notice movement near the ceiling. Someone is standing on a high ledge, holding the end of a rope anchored to a hook in the roof. Before anyone can act, the masked kobold leaps off the ledge and swings down. Many kobolds cry out in alarm, but it's too late - the swinging kobold slams directly into Babanak's side, sending both of them flying into the crowd. The crown, too, tumbles through the air before landing far from the stage.

Immediate chaos ensues. Those near the fallen Babanak try to push back, while those too far away to see clearly try to push forward. Babanak, however, recovers quickly and flies into the air, holding the attacker by their neck. Both are briefly concealed by bright flames, and when then Babanak hovers in the air alone. Then he turns his gaze to the crowd, seeking the crown, but all the kobolds in the hall are already running in too many directions and he must concede defeat.

## Chapter 2 - Investigation

Still in Babanak's throne room, Babanak seems to be lost in thought. Also in the room is **Elned the Wise**, and advisor to Babanak in many things. She clears her throat and he comes back to his senses.

> I'm sure you understand the urgency of the situation. Tuvdak will be expecting a party to deliver the gift at sunset. If we fail to deliver, it is very likely that we shall all be consumed by dragonfire! That is a fate that should be reserved only for our enemies... and for traitors! If you fail to recover the crown and deliver it to Tuvdak by sunset, I can guarantee that none of us - but you in particular - will live to see another day.

At this point the discussion should diverge as the characters begin to interact with Babanak. Before the characters leave, Babanak should tell them the following information.

- All exits from the citadel have been closed and are heavily guarded, preventing anyone from entering or leaving the walled compound.
- Soldiers are already patrolling the streets and tunnels to ensure that everyone stays where they are as much as possible, but the characters themselves will have freedom of movement throughout the entire citadel.
- **Paparnad the Mystic** is currently nowhere to be found - he seemingly vanished immediately after the incident. Babanak doesn't say whether or not he thinks Paparnad might have been involved in the theft of the crown, but he makes it clear that the characters should try to find Paparnad anyway. An insightful character might detect what Babanak believes: that Paparnad has stolen the crown for his own purposes. They might also detect that Babanak is deeply fearful that this might be true.

If the characters ask about the magical properties of the crown, Babanak simply says: "While only a true dragon should be able to wear it, one with sufficient knowledge of its power and the manner of its activation could... ach! It doesn't bear thinking about! They would inevitably become greater and more formidable than any one of us - maybe even all of us together!"

Babanak also suggests investigating Paparnad's private room and workshop - Babanak already looked for him there, but did not fully search the place.

Finally, before the characters leave, **Elned the Wise** gives them a device known as a **Gorgor Counter**, named for **Gorgor the Wise**. A Gorgor Counter clicks when it is near magic, and clicks more quickly near powerful magic.

### Paparnad's chambers

As one of the more notable figures in the **Bekebel** clan, Paparnad has his own private quarters where he sleeps, eats many of his meals, and does some of his research. His private rooms include a bedroom and a study. The study includes a small library of magical tomes.

#### Bedroom

The bedroom has a bed, a bedside table, and a wardrobe. On the bedside table is a cheap novel, a notepad and pen, and a pair of reading glasses. The wardrobe contains fairly typical clothing for a kobold of Paparnad's status.

The notepad has no visible ink markings on it, but very careful inspection of the indentations in the top page might allow a character to guess what was written on the previous page. With a successful check, a character can read "229 SOOT RD". This is the location that Paparnad agreed to meet Satasha after she grabbed the crown.

#### Study

The study includes a writing desk and two bookshelves. On the writing desk is an open book and a set of common writing utensils, as well as some special inks needed by wizards to properly record spells. The shelves contain a small variety of books, mostly about different practices of magic and methods of enchanting magical items.

The open book on the desk is a partial record of all magical artifacts created over the centuries, whether by kobolds or dragons. When the characters find it, it is open to a page summarizing the properties of various magical crowns. It explains that crowns typically bestow mental powers to their users. As an example, the book describes the **Crown of Dominion** as an ancient artifact that would grant the wearer the ability to control the minds of others. Alternatively, a crown called **Citherei** granted its wearer full clarity and independence of mind, blocking any attempts to magical influence the wearer's thoughts.

If the characters closely investigate the bookshelf, they might notice that one of the shelves has a shallower back than the others, implying that there is some space between it and the wall. By carefully prying at the backboard, they might find that it is removable. Behind it is a single book, describing all the dragons that have lived on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron** for the past 800 years. The book is a few decades out of date, but dragons live for centuries so any differences are minor. It is bookmarked to the page about **Ice**, the island's only black dragon. Read the section about [Ice](../locations/oro-oro-ponoro-poron/index.md#ice) to the characters. This should give the characters a strong indication of what Paparnad plans to do with the **Crown of Noruchtohl** if they can make the connection.

### Paparnad's workshop

As one of the clan's leading magical researchers, Paparnad has access to his own private workshop where he tests and develops new spells and magic items. The workshop houses a writing desk where Paparnad makes research notes, and a worktable where he enchants magical items. In the corner is also an empty coat rack.

On the desk is a pile of notes about the Cloak of Invisibility that Paparnad has been developing. The latest notes, dated over the past month, describe various successful tests of the cloak. The final page states that the cloak is almost ready for use - it makes the wearer fully transparent, but a faint shimmer in the air around them would give away their presence to a careful observer.

With the help of the **Gorgor Counter**, the characters might find that there is no Cloak of Invisibility in this room, allowing them to possibly infer that Paparnad is using it to escape.

### The Great Hall

Since the **Great Hall** stands at a crossroads of many important tunnels beneath the **Bekebel Citadel**, it is normally filled with kobolds running to and fro. However, since the lockdown was imposed on the entire citadel, the Great Hall stands eerily empty, the characters' footsteps echoing beneath the lofty ceiling. To add to the lonely feeling, the rope Taccar swung from still hangs above the stage.

The characters might start by finding the place where the **Crown of Noruchtohl** landed in the crowd. In fact, just where they would expect the crown to have fallen, the stone is blackened and cracked, as though lightning had struck that spot. The Gorgor Counter clicks when brought close.

From that spot, the nearest exit is directly north. If the characters choose to investigate the exit, they will find a small scrap of fabric snagged on a splinter of rock. This was Satasha's pocket - and indeed, nearby is a small scrap of paper that reads "229 SOOT RD".

## Chapter 3 - Pursuit

Either from the notepad in Paparnad's chambers or the scrap of paper in the Great Hall, the characters hopefully now know where Paparnad and Satasha met to hand off the **Crown of Noruchtohl**.
