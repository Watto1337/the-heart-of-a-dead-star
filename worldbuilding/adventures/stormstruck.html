    <h1>Stormstruck</h1>
    <p>
      Stormstruck is an adventure for 5th-level characters and follows events beginning in Sibal and extending into Leuber. It is designed to be run in a single session of several hours with an experienced group. No initial understanding of the setting is expected.

          The adventure begins in Trapwater Bay, the main harbour of Sibal. This bay hosts Sibal's largest merchant ships and a good number of casual travelers every day. It is well-protected from strong winds by two artificial breakwaters on either side of the bay and City Hall, Lord Peesha's place of governance, is a short ten-minute walk up the main street. Lord Chewan holds the position of Harbourmaster in Trapwater Bay, an esteemed and powerful position.

          The harbour is bustling with people, as it always is around midday. The skies are clear, and the towers of the Dancers can even be seen in the clouds. The characters should meet here and introduce themselves if they don't know each other yet.

          Once everyone is gathered and familiar, a highly unusual event occurs. Queen Ebb, ruler of the merfolk who live near Sibal, emerges from the waves with eight armed merfolk guards and begins to walk wihout a word towards City Hall. She is immediately recognizable; though she has not set foot on land in over forty years, her image is well known among the population of Sibal and her royal clothing and iconic coral staff additionally mark her as queen. Merfolk normally cannot breathe in air and don't have legs, so it is clear that Queen Ebb and her entourage have used transmutation magic to alter their forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is not clear, however, is that this is not Queen Ebb; in fact, she and her guards aren't even merfolk. They are Dancers, transformed by transmutation magic to look like merfolk. Anyone who can see the true form of shapeshifters will see that they are not merfolk, but otherwise it is not possible to distinguish them. Even a Detect Magic spell will only show that the merfolk are affected by transmutation magic, which is expected. The only clue that this is not Queen Ebb is that she looks surprisingly young, considering she is nearly seventy years old.
        </p>

          The merfolk-not-merfolk march up to City Hall without a word and the people let them pass. They find Lord Peesha waiting for them in the courtyard and, unless it is rudely interrupted by the characters, Lord Peesha and Queen Ebb's discussion goes as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><i>Peesha</i>: May the currents bring you fortune, Queen Ebb of the mighty seas, as your visit is an honor. I assume you have a matter you wish to discuss? You look... very well!</p></li>
          <li><p><i>Ebb</i>: The currents bring fortune only to you, Calas. This is no time for decency. You must remove your ships from my seas at once.</p></li>
          <li><p><i>Peesha</i>: What? Queen Ebb, that is absurd. We need our shipping; Sibal grows no crops, has no livestock. We must import these things from other lands, as we have done for centuries. But I do not wish to make an enemy of you. State your concerns now and we can discuss an equitable solution.</p></li>
          <li><p><i>Ebb</i>: There can no longer be any discussion, Calas. My envoys have been repelled from your shores by your greedy harbourmasters, who wish me and my people had never existed. You see us as an annoyance to be pushed aside.</p></li>
          <li><p><i>Peesha</i>: That is entirely false, Queen Ebb! My harbourmasters would do no such thing. Please speak your request clearly!</p></li>
          <li><p><i>Ebb</i>: That was not a request, Calas!</p></li>
          <p>Queen Ebb slams her coral staff into the ground. Runes briefly glow blue on its surface and a cold wind blows through the square.</p>
          <li><p><i>Ebb</i>: You cannot show me ignorance and then beg for forgiveness. Our storm is brewing, and when it strikes your ships will be smashed to pieces where they lie. Flee now with those you care about most and never sail my seas again.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Queen Ebb turns to leave and everyone in the square starts talking at once. Additionally, in case Queen Ebb's warning was not convincing enough, scouts begin to report a storm blowing in from the north. The news, both of Queen Ebb's visit and of the storm, travels quickly through the city and soon people can be seen with spyglasses looking north from any high place. There is indeed a storm there, and it looks unusually large. The best estimates say it will hit Sibal in a few hours. In order for the adventure to progress, it is critical that the characters leave the island before then.
