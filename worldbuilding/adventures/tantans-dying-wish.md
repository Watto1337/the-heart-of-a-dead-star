title: Tantan's Dying Wish
---

Tantan's Dying Wish is a murder mystery adventure that takes place in and around **Bekebel Citadel** on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**. The attempted murder occurs at **Tantan the Inventor**'s wedding to **Babanak the Great** while the leaders of all nearby clans are present, laying political challenges over an already complicated plot.

## Overview

For many years, **Babanak the Great** has faced pressures to marry so that he may leave heirs that can take over his position of leadership. However, Babanak has love only for **Tantan the Inventor**, a renowned craftswoman known for her practical and influential inventions. Tantan and Babanak have been close since youth, and would have married long ago were it not for the dire warnings given by Babanak's seers.

But now Tantan suffers from a wasting disease. Her sickness, still known only to a few, is weakening her body and the clan's doctors are powerless to heal her. In her final days she made a dying wish to marry Babanak and to carve their love into their clan's history. Babanak agreed, ignoring his seers' foretellings of death and destruction, and together they began planning the wedding. The ceremony is expected to be the most spectacular of the age and the leaders of all nearby clans are invited. Expected are the leaders of three clans: **Dagana**, from the coast; **Perexel**, the dragonless clan; and even **Lukurru**, under a temporary truce with **Bekebel**.

### The plot

Nestled between pillars of rock near the shores of **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**, a scheme is brewing in the mind of **Takala the Spellmaster**. Takala is a powerful and respected member of the **Dagana** clan and an advisor to their leader **Semeret the Motherly**. Knowing that **Dagana the Azure Death** is nearing the end of her life, many Dagana clan members have begun plotting to replace her with their favored successor. In particular, Takala and others seek the strength and protection of **Kormak the Havoc Raiser** and want him to be their clan's overlord. Kormak is fierce and ruthless, much like Dagana once was, and his followers believe he would lead them to greatness. However, Kormak does not yet hold respect from the majority of the clan - in particular, **Semeret the Motherly** despises Kormak and would like nothing better than to see him perish during one of his frequent fights.

In order to foster reverence for Kormak among the clan, Takala has devised a scheme with the aid of an assassin named **Hitch**. Their plan is to take advantage of the existing enmity between the **Bekebel** and the **Lukurru**, sparking a war between them. Then, by joining forces with the Bekebel, **Kormak the Havoc Raiser** could lead the Dagana clan to a great victory over the Lukurru. Kormak prefers to fight the Lukurru because he knows that **Tuvdak the Magnificent**, overlord and protector of the Bekebel clan, is one of the few dragons on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron that could defeat him in single combat. Defeating the Lukurru would also allow the Dagana clan to occupy their territories, expanding into the lush jungles.

Takala's plot has been brewing for years, and now she sees the perfect opportunity to set it in motion at Tantan and Babanak's wedding. With the **Lukurru** present in **Bekebel Citadel**, the Bekebel will already be wary and suspicious of their sworn enemies. So, both to weaken the Bekebel clan and to inspire vengeance against the Lukurru, Takala hired the killer **Hitch** to assassinate both Tantan and Babanak. Even if Hitch fails, she expects the attack to spark a fierce retribution from Bekebel.

## Chapter 1 - Arrivals

The clan leaders begin to arrive as the day of celebration draws near. The first to arrive, two weeks early, are the members of the **Perexel** clan, who live a nomadic lifestyle in the jungle near **Bekebel Citadel**. The Perexel have long been friends of the Bekebel, often protecting wandering Bekebel kobolds from harm. Worshiping no dragons and bearing few possessions, the Perexel had no difficulty in reaching Bekebel Citadel quickly.

The next to arrive a few days later are **Semeret the Motherly**, leader of the **Dagana** clan, and her retinue. Bekebel maintains only a neutral relationship with the Dagana clan, and the two clans do not often interact - however, **Tuvdak the Magnificent** and **Dagana the Azure Death** are some of the oldest dragons on the island, a similarity which brings the two clans closer together.

Last to arrive, appearing at the citadel only a few days before the wedding, are the representatives of the **Lukurru** clan. Currently led by **Irvini the Seer**, the Lukurru have been the sworn enemies of the Bekebel for over two centuries. The tensions between the members of the two clans are very transparent, and Babanak and Irvini exchange hateful glares layered over careful politesse.

Throughout the arrivals of the clans, the characters have an opportunity to mingle with the guests and learn about them through conversation.

## Chapter 2 - The Ceremony

The wedding ceremony goes smoothly and everyone enjoys the celebrations. In fact, it seems as though clan tensions may be loosening. But the following night, the characters awaken to cries for help from Babanak and Tantan's room. They discover that an assassin entered their room during the night and attempted to murder them both. Babanak survived the attack but was badly wounded, and the assassin escaped into the darkness. Tantan, however, had passed away earlier in the night due to her illness. Babanak's injury sent him into a coma, and only time can heal his wounds.
