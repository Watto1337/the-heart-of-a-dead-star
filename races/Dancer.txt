Dancer
	Dancers are a race of semi-humanoids with long, powerful wings in place of arms and four-fingered claws that serve as hands. They live in expansive, feather-light palaces in the clouds that drift with the currents. They wield powerful innate magic that enables them to control the weather, sing songs only some can hear, and more.

	Dancers build their homes in the clouds, and follow them as they drift through the skies. This practice has made them very adaptable to new diets, but has also made their culture very open-minded. Since Dancer communities can split apart at any time, Dancers tend to form only superficial relationships with people, even their own family. They trust easily and make friends quickly, but rarely make deeper connections. This can be beneficial, as it makes them more resilient to loss and change, but it also makes them more vulnerable to loneliness. Another effect of the mobility of their homes is that Dancers have a very generalized culture across the entire continent.

	It is the Dancers's magic, in part, that keep the clouds they live on stable. They normally choose high-altitude clouds that will be above most other weather patterns, and use magically conjured materials to build their homes.
