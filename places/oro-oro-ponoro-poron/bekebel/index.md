The **Bekebel** clan has inhabited **Bekebel Citadel** for hundreds of years, expanding its borders both above and below ground.

## Bekebel Citadel

Bekebel Citadel is a great fortress built on the slopes of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, covering nearly one square mile on the surface and over 12 miles of underground chambers and halls below. Its walls are staunchly defended by archers and advanced weapons of war, including ballistas, trebuchets, and massive bolas, all of which designed to take down attacking dragons. The wall itself is 30 feet thick and braced by metal beams.

The main walled compound is packed with rough buildings and winding alleys through which kobolds bustle at all hours. The kobolds of the Bekebel clan are unusually hard-working and industrious, working feverishly day and night to enlarge their citadel, develop new technologies, or create offerings for their dragon overlord. The underground areas are similar, especially near the surface - except that where kobolds might herd livestock up above, they haul carts of metal or coal down below.
