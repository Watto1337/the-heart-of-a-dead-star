## Crash Home

**Crash Home**, named for the crashing waves that beat against the rocks, is built on wooden posts and rafts nestled among natural pillars of stone rising from the water. All of the Dagana clan currently resides at Crash Home, although it is in fact the third dwelling of the clan - the previous two were destroyed during storms. **Crash Home** was built with this in mind, and so is more resilient to strong winds and tall waves.
