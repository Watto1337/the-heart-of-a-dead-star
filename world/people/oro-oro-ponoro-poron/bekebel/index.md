Bekebel is the largest and most influential kobold clan on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**. Within the impenetrable **Bekebel Citadel**, the Bekebel work tirelessly to sustain their massive population and to enlarge their domain.

The clan worships **Tuvdak the Magnificent**, both earning his protection and suffering his greed. To satisfy Tuvdak, the clan offers him a gift on every ninth day and a greater gift on every eighty-first day. The gifts are crafted by **Babanak the Great**, a powerful sorcerer and the ruler of Bekebel.

## Elned the Wise

**Elned the Wise** is a very old sorcerer loyal to Babanak. She knows much about magical artifacts and the manner of their creation, and they say she can see through any lie.

## Lomon the Warrior

**Lomon the Warrior** is a battle-scarred fighter who once single-handedly slew a green dragon. She is known and feared for her great deeds all across the island.

## Paparnad the Mystic

**Paparnad the Mystic** is a young but talented wizard. Since sorcery is common among kobolds, few bother to study arcane magic. Because of this, Paparnad has made himself useful with a unique set of spells.
