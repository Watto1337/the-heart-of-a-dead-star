Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to many of Torys' greatest dragons, as well as the kobolds who worship them.

## Dragons

Many types of dragons inhabit Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Green dragons lurk in the thick undergrowth while red dragons make their lairs near flowing lava. Blue dragons perch on offshore pillars of stone, and a single black dragon known as **Ice** keeps themself well hidden from those who seek them.

### Tuvdak the Magnificent

Over 600 years old, **Tuvdak the Magnificent** is the oldest red dragon on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Tuvdak is the undisputed King of the Caldera, having driven off or killed as many as eight younger challengers desiring his hoard. He won his current lair from the red dragon **Sarvol the Peerless** after an epic battle lasting days, cementing Tuvdak's reputation as one to be reckoned with. Tuvdak's victory and Sarvol's death marked the end of an era on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron.

### Mosha the All-Knowing

One of the smallest of the already diminutive green dragons, **Mosha the All-knowing** roams the jungle near the foot of the mountain and creeps unseen upon her prey. She wanders free from any lair and often visits the outposts and villages of the **Lukurru** clan, offering wisdom to strengthen them against their enemies. Though she accepts no offerings, Mosha expects greatness from her devotees and punishes their failures with death. Her appearance of omniscience is given by her ability to see more than her eyes alone can spy, appearing to observe events across great distances and through many barriers.

### Ice

While red, green, and blue dragons generally make their presence known, a single black dragon known as **Ice** resides always just out of sight. Ice is rarely seen on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, appearing only to stalk and kill roving groups of kobolds or smaller dragons. Ice's true name is not known, and no kobold clan worships them - some even doubt Ice is real. However, those seeking power beyond their means might leave a small offering out in the jungle, hoping Ice will discover it and pay a visit.

## Kobolds

In addition to its draconic inhabitants, Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to the many kobold clans who worship them. The kobolds thrive in the island's warm environment and work industriously to ensure their clans' success, often in direct competition with one another. Nearly all clans worship one or more dragons, and a clan's draconic overlord often determines the nature of their alliances.

### Bekebel

The **Bekebel** clan is the largest kobold clan on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. They inhabit **Bekebel Citadel** and are led by **Babanak the Great**. The clan worships **Tuvdak the Magnificent**, regularly offering him gifts befitting his title to add to his hoard. The Bekebel are the sworn enemies of the Lukurru.

#### Lukurru

The **Lukurru** clan, while not very large, remains a very influential clan due to their expansive territory and unrivaled fighting force. They worship all green dragons, including **Mosha the All-knowing** whom they both fear and make their prayers to. The Lukurru are the sworn enemies of the Bekebel.

#### Dagana

The **Dagana** clan lives on a large network of floating huts, anchored to tall pillars of rock emerging from the sea near the shore. They worship **Dagana the Azure Death**, an old blue dragon several centuries past her prime. As long as the Dagana lives, her namesake clan will remain strong - but scheming has already begun among the clan's members to ensure that their favored dragon will take Dagana's place when she passes.
