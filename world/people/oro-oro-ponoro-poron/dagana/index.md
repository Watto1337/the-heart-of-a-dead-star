title: Dagana
---

**Dagana** is a seafaring clan that worships **Dagana the Azure Death**, an ancient blue dragon. Dagana is greatly weakened by her age, and her namesake clan knows this - indeed, certain members of the clan have been scheming for decades to succeed Dagana with their favored draconic overlord when she dies.

**Dagana the Azure Death** created the **Dagana** clan after gaining a large following for her prowess in warfare. As her clan grew and new followers joined, Dagana led them to countless glorious victories. Now, in her senility, she is too weak to go to war, and the Dagana clan has not won a battle in over a hundred years. Many members of the clan resent Dagana's age and wish for the clan's glorious past to return, while others have departed the Dagana clan in favor of other clans.

## Members of the Clan

### Semeret the Motherly

**Semeret the Motherly**, a capable elemental mage, is the leader of the **Dagana** clan. Like all the leaders of the Dagana clan before her, Semeret was selected by **Dagana the Azure Death** to rule. Unlike any previous clan leaders, however, Semeret has no interest in warfare. She instead prefers to foster symbiotic relationships with other clans. In particular, Semeret spends much of her time mending the relationship between Dagana and **Lukurru**, which was sullied by centuries of war.

**Semeret the Motherly** takes on a gentle tone, even when pressed. She is often willing to compromise and is nearly incapable of lying, qualities which make some doubt Dagana's wisdom in selecting her to lead. Nonetheless, she holds the clan's survival and success in the highest regard and makes many personal sacrifices for the good of the clan.

### Other notable individuals

#### Takala the Spellmaster

**Takala the Spellmaster** is one of the Dagana clan's most powerful wizards. A master of the arcane, Takala is sometimes considered to be the rightful leader of the Dagana clan. She is sharp, commanding, and refuses to back down in the face of adversity. In her, many see the spirit of Dagana's past. Takala is committed to seeing that past return and has been scheming for many years to replace **Dagana the Azure Death** with **Kormak the Havoc Raiser** when Dagana dies. Kormak, like Dagana once was, is an unstoppable killer and thrives on victory in battle.

#### Urbul the Mystic

**Urbul the Mystic** is a druid well versed in healing magic. He is a primary supporter of **Semeret the Motherly** and shares many of her generous qualities.
