Bekebel is the largest and most influential kobold clan on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**. Within the impenetrable **Bekebel Citadel**, the Bekebel work tirelessly to sustain their massive population and to enlarge their domain.

The clan worships **Tuvdak the Magnificent**, both earning his protection and suffering his greed. To satisfy Tuvdak, the clan offers him a gift on every ninth day and a greater gift on every eighty-first day. The gifts are crafted by **Babanak the Great**, a powerful sorcerer and the ruler of Bekebel.
