title: Tuvdak the Magnificent
---

Over 600 years old, **Tuvdak the Magnificent** is the oldest red dragon on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Tuvdak is the undisputed King of the Caldera, having driven off or killed as many as eight younger challengers desiring his hoard. He won his current lair from the red dragon **Sarvol the Peerless** after an epic battle lasting days, cementing Tuvdak's reputation as one to be reckoned with. Tuvdak's victory and Sarvol's death marked the end of an era on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron.
