title: Babanak the Great
---

**Babanak the Great** has ruled the **Bekebel** clan with an iron fist for 59 years. He is proud, arrogant, and easily angered - qualities which temper his popularity. As a natural-born sorcerer, he has impressive magical powers and longer life than most kobolds. Unlike many rulers on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**, he keeps no treasure hoard for himself and seems to have little ambition - that is, little ambition beyond ruling the most powerful kobold clan on the island. Yet despite his fiery personality, the **Bekebel** clan has grown larger and more powerful than ever before under his rule.

In addition to providing leadership and judgement to the clan, Babanak holds the responsibility of creating many of the clan's offerings to **Tuvdak the Magnificent**. A very capable blacksmith and sorcerer, Babanak often forges and enchants Tuvdak's gifts himself. He also works with some of the clan's master blacksmiths to forge unique shapes, and **Elned the Wise** and **Paparnad the Mystic** to weave greater enchantments.

## Role-playing Babanak

### Personality

Babanak sees the world through a critical and self-centered lens, evaluating his experiences only in terms of the impact they have had on him. He is efficient and critical, being nearly as critical of others as he is of himself. Nonetheless, he feels a great pride in having risen to a position of power - a pride which has made him arrogant and insensitive in recent years. He takes insults to heart and allows them to feed his self-doubt, a behavior he conceals by responding with notoriously fierce rebukes.

### Motives

Babanak acts in accordance with a complex array of desires. His primary motive, always looming above the others, is the need for excellence. He sets high standards for himself over and above the expectations others have of him, and he goes to great lengths to attain them. He is also motivated by his desire for power. Though he would be ashamed to admit it, much of what Babanak does as the leader of the **Bekebel** clan is engineered to further elevate his standing.
Third, Babanak seeks security for his clan, placing its safety above his own. He works tirelessly to anticipate potential threats to the **Bekebel** and to take preventative measures against them. Finally, Babanak acts in accordance with his love for **Tantan the Inventor**. Many of Babanak's seemingly uncharacteristic decisions can be explained by his consideration for Tantan's particular needs.

### Background

**Gava the Supreme**, Babanak's mother, ruled the **Bekebel** clan during the entirety of Babanak's childhood. She attended to her son infrequently and sporadically, often visiting him at odd hours of the day only to speak a few words.
