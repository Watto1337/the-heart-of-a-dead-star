title: Babanak the Great
---

**Babanak the Great** has ruled the Bekebel clan with an iron fist for 59 years. He is proud, arrogant, and easily angered - qualities which temper his popularity. As a natural-born sorcerer, he has impressive magical powers and longer life than most kobolds. Unlike many rulers on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, he keeps no treasure hoard for himself and seems to have little ambition - that is, little ambition beyond ruling the most powerful kobold clan on the island. Yet despite his fiery personality, the Bekebel clan has grown larger and more powerful than ever before under his rule.

In addition to providing leadership and judgement to the clan, Babanak holds the responsibility of creating many of the clan's offerings to **Tuvdak the Magnificent**. A very capable blacksmith and sorcerer, Babanak often forges and enchants Tuvdak's gifts himself. He also works with some of the clan's master blacksmiths to forge unique shapes, and **Elned the Wise** and **Paparnad the Mystic** to weave greater enchantments.
