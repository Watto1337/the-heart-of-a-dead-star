title: Oro-oro-ponoro-poron
---

The great island-mountain of **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron** is home to many of Torys' greatest dragons. Lying in one of Torys' tropical regions and further heated by the island's volcanic peak, the island is covered in lush vegetation even in the coldest winters. The slopes climb steeply from the shore, making the island a tough habitat for anyone not at home in trees or underground.

## Locations

### The caldera

The caldera of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is a sight to behold. The magma filling it constantly bubbles and churns, emitting tremendous heat and noxious fumes. Dragons and kobolds alike hold superstitions about it, such as that **Tiamat** will one day return to the island by emerging from the volcano in a violent eruption. Some also believe that the future can be discerned in its random bubbling, although interpretations differ. Nevertheless, those who peer into the magmatic crater tend to be changed by it in a way that cannot be explained by fumes alone. Many sorcerers only learn how to work magic after they have gazed into the caldera, while others claim to see visions of distant times. Visions from the caldera are unpleasant, often depicting the fiery death of one's enemies - or friends.

## Wildlife

In addition to dragons and kobolds, the jungles of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron are inhabited by a plethora of wild animals.

### Chupacabra

The chupacabra is a dog-like creature with four powerful legs and a high arcing back. It stalks its prey in total silence, waiting until the last moment to pounce. Chupacabras live and hunt in small packs of two to three. They mostly avoid gangs of kobolds, preferring to stay well hidden in the safety of the jungle.

### Stonebeak

Stonebeaks are large flightless birds that subsist on anything that doesn't move. The wander the jungles in flocks of ten to twenty in search of lush undergrowth, carcasses, and the nests of other stonebeaks. Dragons, kobolds, and chupacabras alike prey on stonebeaks.
