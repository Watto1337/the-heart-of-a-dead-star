## Woodrock

**Woodrock** is a village at the heart of the Lukurru lands. Though it is the largest of the Lukurru villages, it is small compared to **Bekebel Citadel** and is barely fortified. Nonetheless, it has never been taken by invaders thanks to the unrivaled fighting prowess of the clan's soldiers.

## Highvine Watch

**Highvine Watch** is a tall standing stone tucked away deep in the jungle. It is the seat of **Irvini the Seer**, leader of the Lukurru, who oversees the clan's activities from afar with powerful divination magic. Highvine Watch is entirely undefended except by a small staff of seasoned warriors, but it is hidden from sight by an illusion spell cast on the site once every hundred years.
