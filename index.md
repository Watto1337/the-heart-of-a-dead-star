title: Welcome to Torys!
---

Torys is a ring-shaped planet populated with familiar fantasy themes. These include elements inspired by well-known settings such as J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, George R. R. Martin's Westeros, and Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld, as well as creatures and spells from Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy games. Torys is designed to be used in role-playing games, making it easily accessible in D&D or any other role-playing framework.
