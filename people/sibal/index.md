## Culture

All the races of the world are represented in Sibal. Only the merfolk, living beneath the waves, have no business on land.

## Government

Sibal is ruled democratically by Lord Calas.

## Geography

Sibal lies in the inner half of Torys and the **Eclipse** occurs shortly after midday every day. Since it receives less sunlight, Sibal is colder than other places of the same latitude, especially in the winter. Druids, warlocks, and masters of the arcane can all take advantage of the power of the Eclipse to bolster their magic, at the risk of their spells working against them.
