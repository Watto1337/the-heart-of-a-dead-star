title: Ahahbu
---

**Ahahbu** is the healer of Day's End. She is constantly patching up cuts, broken bones, and worse. She has some limited magical abilities; she can cast Spare the Dying at will and Goodberry once per day, and she can prepare one Potion of Healing per week from 25gp worth of materials. She tries to keep one to three potions at hand for emergencies; roll 1d4 - 1 to determine how many potions she has at any given time.

Ahahbu has a dark secret; she is, in fact, a **Druid of the Eclipse**. Though her powers would be relatively weak even during the noon-night, she becomes stronger with each passing Eclipse. Druids of the Eclipse, like lycanthropes, derive their strength from the night-in-the-day, and become more powerful where the Eclipses are longer and more extreme. Much farther west of Day's End, it would be nearly impossible for a powerful druid to resist the corruption the darkness brings. Ahahbu is not severely affected because her powers are few as it is, and the Eclipses are very brief in Day's End. But she does feel the pull towards the darkness, and is slowly learning to use more magic.
