title: Dagana
---

**Dagana** is a seafaring clan that worships **Dagana the Azure Death**, an ancient blue dragon. Dagana is greatly weakened by her age, and her namesake clan knows this - indeed, certain members of the clan have been scheming for decades to succeed Dagana with their favored draconic overlord when she dies.

**Dagana the Azure Death** created the **Dagana** clan after gaining a large following for her prowess in warfare. As her clan grew and new followers joined, Dagana led them to countless glorious victories. Now, in her senility, she is too weak to go to war, and the Dagana clan has not won a battle in over a hundred years. Many members of the clan resent Dagana's age and wish for the clan's glorious past to return, while others have departed the Dagana clan in favor of other clans.
