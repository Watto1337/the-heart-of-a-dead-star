title: Lukurru
---

The **Lukurru** clan dwells in the thick jungle on **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**, occupying a vast territory. They worship all green dragons, whom they interact with daily in many aspects of their lives. Above all, however, they praise **Mosha the All-knowing**, who guides the clan with her near-omniscience and punishes their failures with death.
