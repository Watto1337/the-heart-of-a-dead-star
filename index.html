    <h1>Welcome to Torys!</h1>
    <p>
      Torys is a fantasy setting designed by Arlo Watts in collaboration with the community. The setting exists on the ring-shaped planet Torys, an inhabited realm with familiar fantasy themes. These include elements inspired by well-known settings such as J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, George R. R. Martin's Westeros, and Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld. Torys is additionally designed to be used in role-playing games, making it easily accessible in Dungeons & Dragons or any other role-playing framework.
